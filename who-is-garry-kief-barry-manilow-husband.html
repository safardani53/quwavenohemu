"It takes enormous savvy and know-how to book and market complicated arena tours, choreograph promotion, direct the entire team and make it look effortless, and that part is Garry's domain. A major career takes two. Between them, there is enormous comfort and trust."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an appearance on Who's Talking to Chris Wallace? in November 2023, Manilow credited Keif for keeping him out of trouble at the height of his career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Garry saved my life</a>.

"I needed to be able to come home to a place where it was peaceful. It's peaceful here. It is the absolute opposite of what my 45-year career has been."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-has-one-daughter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He has one daughter</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Kief and Manilow met, the talent manager's daughter, Kirsten, was only a year old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Garry and I have been together going on 40 years, and we raised a daughter," Manilow revealed during an interview with writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Michael Cavacini</a> in 2017.
