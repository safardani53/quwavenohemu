Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/yung-miami-kodak-black-propose-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-3435424></span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kodak Black</strong></a> proposed to&nbsp;<strong>Yung Miami</strong> in front of a massive crowd on Dec. 9, which can be seen in the video below, obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. However, it seems like there’s a little bit more to the story and these two aren’t&nbsp;exactly engaged. Kodak reportedly used a purple Ring Pop to pop the question, and he put the ring on Yung Miami’s&nbsp;right hand, rather than her left engagement finger, after proposing. Even though the two embraced for quite a while after the proposal, the whole thing was reportedly just staged for a music video, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MoneyAndHipHop.com</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The two were spotted packing on the PDA on-set, although it’s unclear whether or not it was&nbsp;all for video purposes, or if there actually is something going on between the pair in real life. Yung Miami is a member of the hip-hop duo,&nbsp;<strong>City Girls</strong>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was linked</a> to&nbsp;<strong>Drake</strong> earlier this year after he posted a photo of them partying in the club together following one of his shows. City Girls’ other member,&nbsp;<strong>JT</strong>, turned herself in on fraud chargers back in June 2018, and is currently serving a prison sentence. She is not expected out of jail until March 2020, and Yung Miami is clearly making sure her career doesn’t suffer in the meantime!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Interestingly, this is not the first time Kodak Black has left people confused with a proposal. Back in Nov. 2017, he was seen on video asking&nbsp;<strong>Cuban Doll</strong> — yes, the woman caught in the middle of&nbsp;<strong>Cardi B</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Offset’s</strong> breakup — to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>propose to him</a> with his own ring. She obliged, and then the two celebrated by surrounding themselves with money. Again, this seemed like another instance of the rapper goofing around.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kodak was just released from prison in Aug. 2018, and he’s clearly wasted no time getting back to work. He’s expected to release his new album,&nbsp;Dying to Live, on Dec. 14, 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5ze5BqZqSnlJa4bq7LmpqkZaCnvLG70pqjZrGlo7RuuciapKJlop67qHnPqKdmrpmZsrB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-forman.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Peter Forman net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
