Because she now does so with the knowledge that Jen was lying to their faces.</p><p>“That’s just what she’s brilliant at,” Whitney shadily complimented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“And there was a point where she had me thinking, ‘Maybe this is a mess,'” Whitney confessed.</p><p>She recalled having wondered “‘Maybe this is a messed up situation where someone flipped on her. Maybe she didn’t know.’”</p><p>Clearly, that does not appear to have been the case at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>During BravoCon last month, Andy Cohen hinted that Jen’s guilty plea may have spelled the end of her time on the show.</p><p>“Once we wrapped she pled guilty,” he noted at the time.</p><p>Andy then continued: “I think that was kind of, unfortunately, the end of, you know, the engagement there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“But I hope to sit down with her and talk to her at some point on camera,” Andy said at the time.</p><p>He hoped to chat with Jen “because I have a lot of questions for her.”</p><p>Season 4 has not yet begun filming. But it feels possible that Jen’s time on Bravo could be over. Or not. We’ll see.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Whitney emphasized that she, too, wishes to speak to Jen.</p><p>She has not spoken with her since Jen blindsided the entire cast with her plea change.</p><p>Not getting to hear her explain herself would feel like, among other things, a missed opportunity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“It’s gonna be unfortunate if we don’t get that chance to sit down,” Whitney expressed.</p><p>She wants to meet “and talk through not only her pleading guilty, but all of the things that we went through this last year together.”</p><p>Whitney noted that “If we don’t get that chance, then that’s unfortunate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That said, Whitney is no longer interested in being the “orchestrator” of healing for the entire cast.</p><p>“I can’t do the work for other people,” she admitted. “I’ve always tried to be the peacemaker and bring everyone together, definitely because of my childhood.”</p><p>Whitney concluded: “And I’ve just realized that doesn’t translate with this group of friends. And it’s not my burden to bear — it’s theirs.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2BcMPHoqunnaliv7C%2FxGagZq%2BRo8FutsSnZKygkZ16tbuMmqWsr5Wneqe70WajsqGenHq1u4yuqmaZnKF6tbTIrGStoZ2afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-margolis-wife-jacqueline.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mark Margolis' wife, Jacqueline?</span></a>
