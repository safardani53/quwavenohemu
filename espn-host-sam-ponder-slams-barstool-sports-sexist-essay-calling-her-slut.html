Your entire career and livelihood is based on appealing to guys like me and blogs like ours. Bottomline [sic] is guys thinking chicks are hot is natural. It’s Darwinism. It’s never gonna change. But that doesn’t mean we don’t respect women and think it’s okay to hit a woman. I have no idea what’s so confusing about that. Go [expletive] yourself.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Katz responded to the tweet, claiming he did not write the post nor the editor’s note that referred to her as a “bible thumping freak.” He also said he defended her in a video segment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Hey Sam, thanks for the welcome. I just want to clear one thing up, I didn’t write this blog post (you make it seem like I did) and the rundown you reference I actually defended you,” he replied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ponder took to Twitter again on Tuesday to place the blame on Barstool founder and president Dave Portnoy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was wrong in thinking @BarstoolBigCat wrote that article & called me a slut repeatedly. He just continuously laughed along,” she wrote. “It was the PRESIDENT of @barstoolsports who said these things. Happy to clarify.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A recording from 2014, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter user @sensitivemann shared</a> with Ponder Monday night, features a conversation between Portnoy and Katz. Portnoy suggested that Ponder “sex it up and be slutty,” while Katz added, “There’s no one worse right now than Samantha Ponder. She is the absolute worst. I hate-follow her on Twitter. I can’t even stand her. Every time she tweets I want to puke all over my computer.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Wednesday morning, Ponder sent out a series of tweets that addressed the controversy again, stating in part that “I am disappointed that we are promoting a company name that still maintains support for horrific personal attacks against multiple women within ESPN.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The female CEO of Barstool Sports, Erika Nardini, spoke out in a series of tweets Tuesday night, and said that “there are certain vulnerabilities that come with growing up on the internet. If you want controversies, we have them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also wrote, “Barstool grew an undeniable audience because it was unafraid to have a hot take, an unpopular opinion or to cross the line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ESPN’s Executive Vice President Burke Magnus<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> told USA Today</a>that “the comments about Sam Ponder were offensive and inappropriate, and we understand her reaction. She is a valued colleague and doing a great job for us. As stated previously, we do not control the content of Barstool Sports. We are doing a show with Big Cat and PFT, and we do have final say on the content of that show.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ponder’s husband, former NFL quarterback Christian Ponder, responded to her tweet, “Proud of you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0micrKieYrWwv9NmqpqlXaW8r7DEq2SspJGiwG6uwKuqraefoXq0vM6rq6xlo5rFqr%2FTZpysq5GueqSty6Wgp59dnbKzedKlrK1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-in-paris-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of Lily Collins On Season 2 Set &amp;amp; More Hollywood Life</span></a>
