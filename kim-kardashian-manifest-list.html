She's also looking for someone with the following qualities: "good hygiene, calm, no mom or dad issues, patient, supportive, genuinely happy for me, successful, good teeth."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kim Kardashian (@kimkardashian)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>"Teeth are like one of my biggest turn-ons," Kim explained in a confessional. "The straighter, the hornier I'll get. Just kidding, but not kidding."</p><p>She later told the cameras that she'd be down to get a man veneers if he had a good enough personality.</p><p>She continued to rattle off her list, "Spontaneous, fun, my friends and family love him, someone that can be a role model for my kids (especially that my boys can look up to), no heavy baggage, taller than me, someone that loves to workout, motivated, independent person that’s not clingy, someone with good taste, no balding.”</p><p>On the last comment, she flip-flopped, "But then I don't know, if I'm also in love like I'll rub your bald head, you know what I mean?"</p><p>Kanye notably has sported a bald head.</p><p>But that's not all. Kim also says she wants someone with a scent she'll love, even at the gym, and she wants who's down to get facials and laser treatment. She wants someone who can read a room and respect others even when no one is watching.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Kim's list inspired by the romantic misfires of her past?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson at the White House Correspondents Dinner.</p></figure><p>Kim has been married three times, the longest and most high-profile being her marriage to Kanye West. As a power couple, they were so ubiquitous and intrinsic to pop culture that fans and the general public alike referred to them as "Kimye."</p><p>But Kanye West's multiple public breakdowns and horrible treatment of Kim led to the dissolution of their marriage.</p><p>As Kim tried to move on with Pete Davidson, Kanye launched a dangerous hate campaign against Kim and Pete resulting in a troubling music video and sporadic social media meltdowns that alienated former collaborators. West's downfall eventually came with his antisemitic and white supremacist remarks.</p><p>After nine months of dating, Kim and Pete parted ways. In the show, Kim alluded that West's hate campaign took a toll on Pete and strained their relationship. She has nothing but kind words for Pete, but now she's looking for a man around her age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMppinoZaawLV5y6KqrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keke-palmer-performs-ungorgeous-2023-soul-train-awards-amid-custody-battle-8406802.html><span>←</span><span>Keke Palmer Performs Emotional Breakup Song at Soul Train Awards amid Custody Battle</span></a>
