Trials showed Asda’s factor 30 came out best on test, while the same product made by Avon did not offer anywhere near the protection it claimed – putting Brits at risk of burning.
Natalie Hitchins, of Which?, said: “It is great to see cheaper sunscreens available on the high street at a time where consumers need affordable options."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
