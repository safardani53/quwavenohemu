“Time Is Running Our For Gina."</p><p>To date, it has garnered nearly one million views on YouTube.</p><p>“My life’s been hard,” Krasley said in her heartbreaking introduction to the show, adding at one point:</p><p>"I always felt my entire life like I was just pushed under the rug.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

being abandoned was eating — and by the time I was 10, I was already over 150 pounds."</p><p>By age 14, Gina weighed more than 300 pounds, yet she continued to turn to food as an “escape,” she explained as a cast member:</p><p>“As I was getting closer to 500 pounds, it started to get harder to do things.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

loving family on Sunday August 1st, 2021…</strong></p><p><strong>Her greatest passion was dancing and she would make up dances with her sister and kids in the neighborhood growing up.</strong></p><p><strong>She started the ‘dancing has no size limit’ Tiktok trend and she dreamed of one day opening up a dance studio for special needs children.</strong></p><p><strong>Gina once appeared in a movie when she was younger called Walking to the Waterline and she enjoyed playing video games and spending time with her family.</strong></p><img

a young girl.</p><p>“My weight started to cause problems for me because I started getting bullied a lot, so that led to me acting out and getting punished a lot, which made things even worse — especially with my dad ‘cause he was the enforcer,” she said.</p><p>“When I did something wrong and he was upset, my punishments from him could get brutal.</p><p>"He would hit me, pull my hair, but at a young age, I didn’t know that was abuse.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Tweeted TLC in response to this sad news:</p><p>“TLC was deeply
