In the mid-'80s, she established herself as an actress through her starring roles in The Woman in Red (1984), Weird Science (1985) and later Hard to Kill (1990), in which she appeared opposite Seagal.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kelly LeBrock (left) and Steven Seagal at the premiere of "Out for Justice" in 1991.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tom Wargacki/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1987, LeBrock and Seagal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>married</a> and had three children — Annaliza, 30, Dominic, 27, and Arissa, 24 — over the course of their nine-year marriage (they divorced in 1996).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the former couple's public split, LeBrock — mostly — retreated away from the entertainment industry and found "purpose" in the two decades she spent dedicating her life to motherhood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Becoming a mom gave me purpose, resilience and a reason to get up in the morning," LeBrock shared. "And sexiness comes from experience, not being young, so I feel sexier than ever!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, the mother of three is returning to Hollywood — this time with her youngest daughter, Arissa, an aspiring model. On Wednesday evening, the pair made a red carpet appearance for the premiere of the new reality Lifetime series Growing Up Supermodel, in which they both star. The series takes viewers behind the scenes with a crop of fledgling models who try to live up to the successes of their well-known parents and follows the drama of making it in the modeling world for seven famous celeb kids, including Arissa.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kelly (left) and Arissa LeBrock.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kelly (left) and Arissa LeBrock.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jesse Grant/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And LeBrock, who has appeared in a handful of projects since leaving Hollywood (most recently, the TV movie A Prince for Christmas), is now returning with more self-confidence than she had years ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you get to my age, you grow some balls," she quipped. "When I was touted as a sex symbol and beautiful and blah, blah, blah, the irony is that I didn't feel it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Now that I'm more mature and wrinkled — I actually do have wrinkles! — I'm much more comfortable in my skin," said LeBrock, who is now <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>married to retired investment banker Fred Steck</a>. "I'm happy with who I am and where I am."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although her relationship with Seagal, 65, is still strained, she remains positive about the future. "It's been very sad because it affects the children," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But I've been married three times so far, and my attitude is, 'Never give up!'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Growing Up Supermodel airs Wednesdays (10 p.m. ET) on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKyxy6WwZqSVl7%2Bwr8pmrqGxXai1pnnDnpqinJWZerLByK1koaecoca4u86dZJqepJq%2FbrDIr6arm5ViwLWx1Z6lZquVlrSiuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katulka.html><span>←</span><span>Katulka- Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Nationality</span></a>
