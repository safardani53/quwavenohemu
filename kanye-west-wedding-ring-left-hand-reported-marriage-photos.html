While Kanye has kept<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> his usually loose lips</a> sealed about his marital status, he seemingly hinted at a romance with Bianca in his new song, “Censori Overload”, which clearly uses her last name. In the lyrics of the song, he sings of a past breakup — potentially his and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>‘s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recently finalized divorce</a>. “Wakin’ up to ‘I can’t do this any more’ texts,” he sings before potentially commenting on his new marriage. “And the Bible said I can’t have any more sex till marriage,” he says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The controversial<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> father of four</a> shared the song in a since-deleted <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post from Dec. 7, 2022. “Censori overload.

She obtained her master’s in architecture from the University of Melbourne in 2020 as well. The natural brunette-turned-platinum blonde previously revealed she spends her time in Melbourne and Los Angeles. “In Melbourne I can cultivate my creativity and LA is where I apply it,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Australian Vogue</a> in June 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As fans know, Kim, 42, and Kanye <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finalized their divorce</a> in Nov. 2022 after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announcing their split</a> in early 2021.
