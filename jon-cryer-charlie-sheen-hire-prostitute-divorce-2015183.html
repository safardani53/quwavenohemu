<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Jon Cryer: Charlie Sheen Helped Me Hire a Prostitute After My Divorce</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>What are friends for? According to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Charlie Sheen</a></strong>, a good pal helps his friend hire a prostitute while he’s getting over his divorce. In 2004, <strong>Jon Cryer</strong> split from his wife of five years, <strong>Sarah Trigger</strong>. In the Two and a Half Men star’s new tell-all memoir, So That Happened, he talks about how Sheen, 49, leant a helping hand during the painful breakup.</p><p>“I was in a bad state right after my divorce, and I certainly didn’t feel dateable,” Cryer, 49, wrote in the memoir (via <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>). “I was an emotional basket case… I decided I might as well pay someone for company and certain intimate pleasures so that I could at least get my equilibrium back with the opposite sex. Charlie suggested a few online purveyors he used, as this was when prostitution was gaining a foothold on the Internet.”</p><p>He goes on to detail an awkward exchange he had with a prostitute that ended up being not-so sexy.</p><p>“It was really a very friendly experience, maybe because the act of having sex is quite the conversational icebreaker,” he continued. “The next time, I went to her place, which probably wasn’t really her place. We sat down, tried to make small talk and halfheartedly stumbled into a conversation about recent fluctuations in the stock market. Somehow I ended up spending 25 minutes of my hour helping her with financial planning.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jon-cryer-charlie-sheen-two-and-a-half-men-lg.jpg><p>As for Sheen, Cryer had sympathy for his former costar and close friend. He revealed that the Platoon actor once asked him to hide a giant bag of porn from then-wife <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Denise Richards</a></strong>.</p><p>“He handed me a heavy shopping bag. ‘Denise is coming over,’ he said, ‘and I need you to hide something for me,’” Cryer wrote.</p><p>But when Sheen fell off the wagon and started using again, the Pretty in Pink star found it hard to defend his friend. After Sheen made his very public and damning exit from the hit CBS sitcom, Cryer detailed some of the negative backlash he received.</p><p>“An astounding number of people stood up for Charlie, as though people should be able to show up to work rarely, if at all, verbally abuse their co-workers publicly with anti-Semitic slurs, get arrested on a regular basis — as well as abuse drugs to the point where they can barely function — and not have their high-paying jobs threatened,” he wrote. “They directed their fury at Chuck [Lorre] but also at me, with hundreds of comments about how I’d betrayed Charlie, that I was a ‘homely f-g’ and that they’d never watch a show with me as the lead. As ridiculous and horrifying as those sentiments were, it was impossible for me not to feel their effect.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sheen was eventually replaced by <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Ashton Kutcher</a></strong>, who played new leading man, Walden Schmidt, and the show went on for another four seasons before the series finale this past February.</p><p>Jon Cryer’s memoir, So That Happened, will be released on April 7.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp55isLPFxKtknKCRp7mqsYysn56dnmK1qr7EZqerp6OptrXB055knaGmpL%2BksYxrZ2ptYW2AcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-was-video-game-nut-inspiration-movie-gran-turismo.html><span>←</span><span>I was a video game addict who failed his driving test - now I'm a professional racer and was even sn</span></a>
