Gerald was such a bundle of energy and had focus from such an early age; it was wonderful," she said.</p><p>"As an artist, to be part of it - to recognize I had this intensely creative son - I felt an obligation to be supportive.</p><p>"I believe all children should be exposed to music. I found a very good piano teacher for him when he was in first grade," she continued.</p><p>"By the fifth grade, he wanted to learn composition. I prioritized things like that on a limited budget.</p><p>"As hip-hop and rap entered his world by the age of 11 or 12, I came up with a plan that I didn’t limit what he could listen to. I told him, 'You can buy any CD you want, but at 9 o’clock we shift to classical music.'"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>What was Suzanne Olmsted's cause of death?</h2><p>On Wednesday, November 24, 2021, G-Eazy took to his Instagram to share that his mother had passed away.</p><p>Currently, no cause of death has been shared with the public.</p><p>Alongside a series of photos of his mother, he posted a heartfelt tribute to his late mother.</p><p>"I love you so much. The shock still won’t let me accept the feeling that I’ll never get to hug you in person again. My queen, my hero, my everything… my mom.</p><p>"The tears won’t stop. My eyes hurt, my face hurts, my body hurts, everywhere hurts. There’s no safe place to hide and there’s no way to lay, sit, or stand that doesn’t hurt.</p><p>"The pain is enormous. But I know you’re out of yours and that brings me peace. I love you so much," he added, which leads many to believe his mother died from an unconfirmed illness.</p><p>"The power of your plight to survive and protect us against all odds will forever be awe-inspiring. You were the definition of super-human… the context of which I gained gradually throughout my life.</p><p>G-Eazy went on to convey that his mother had once sent him a letter which led him to get treatment for his alcohol and drug addiction, while adding that he was worried about her physical health.</p><p>"You loved your two boys more than life itself and we love you the same. Luckily we have each other to hold and to lean on and that’s all that matters," he added.</p><p>"Our hearts are broken, but they are full of love and gratitude for the life you gave us. With us always… we love you mom."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695900721.jpg><h2>Who is G-Eazy?</h2><p>G-Eazy was born and raised in California, and started making music around 2008.</p><p>A few years later, in 2010, he was given the opportunity to open up for some notable rappers, including Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg.</p><p>As his mixtapes started to gain traction, G-Eazy went on tour opening for Shwayze in 2011, followed by a series of Vans Warped Tour performances in 2012.</p><p>On June 23, 2014, G-Eazy released his major-label debut album, These Things Happen, earning a number three spot on the Billboard Hot 200 chart.</p><p>The same year, he embarked on his first headlining tour, travelling around the world to play his music.</p><p>G-Eazy has collaborated with many fellow rappers, including Tyga and Gunna.</p><p>He has also notably dated a multitude of famous women, including <a href=#>Halsey</a>, <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a>, and <a href=#>Lana del Rey</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2>What is G-Eazy's net worth?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, G-Eazy has an estimated net worth of around $12million.</p><p>In 2017, he won Favorite Hip-Hop Artist at the People's Choice Awards.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYWiGd3%2BUaK6hp12srrR5xmacmrKpYrqwuYysrLOZnqOybrvLpqqtnZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-danko.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Danko</span></a>
