Moore</a> got into a heated argument over Kenya's claims of the She by Sheree founder's boyfriend being a "cheater."</p><p>The Detroit native alleged <a href=#>Martell</a>, 41, slid into her DMs and shouted at him: "Once a cheater, always a cheater, you f***ing piece of s**t."</p><p>Now, The U.S. Sun can exclusively report Martell has also been accused of child abuse in court filings by his ex-wife Melody, 37.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Alabama</a> court documents obtained by The U.S. Sun, Melody sought a protection order against Martell on January 11, 2022.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on RHOA">Read More on RHOA</h2><p>Although details of the protection order are sealed, The U.S. Sun has learned that the order was to protect their children.</p><p>The former couple have four kids together: daughters Maliah, Mariah, Malani, and son Martell.</p><p>In addition, Martell is also the father to another child, son Knox, with a woman who has been identified as his mistress, Arionne Curry.</p><p>Melody filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly 12 years of marriage due to his long-term affair, which he has admitted to and <a href=#>called "foolish."</a></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2><strong>NEW ALLEGATIONS</strong></h2><p>According to a separate filing that is part of Melody and Martell's divorce case, Martell filed a petition on January 26, 2022, to modify the custody arrangement, requesting sole physical custody, and to notify the court that Melody has "violated" clauses made in the final order back in March 2021.</p><p>He made claims that Melody, whom he starred with on OWN's Love & Marriage: Huntsville, has denied him time with their four minor children and has cut off communication.</p><p>In one instance, he stated that she showed up to her house one night in November 2021 after not being able to say good night to their kids, according to the docs, and so she "served him with a trespass notice."</p><p>Martell then shed light on the protection order sought by Melody where he denied any abuse.</p><p>He wrote in the filing: "The plaintiff has falsely accused the defendant of child abuse in a separate protection from abuse action.</p><p>"Plaintiff's accusation comes as she learned this modification action was coming through the reality show both parties are contracted with and sought to pre-empt this filing."</p><p>The protection order was then dismissed on March 7, 2022.</p><h2><strong>HE SAID VS SHE SAID</strong></h2><p>The Dollhouse star fired back in her answer to her ex's petition to modify the custody and "hold the Plaintiff in contempt."</p><p>She alleged: "[Martell's] discipline and punishment of the children is excessive and abusive.</p><p>"The Defendant has used objects to hit his children hard enough to draw blood, he has spanked them excessively, and he has used slurs and other insults towards his children as discipline techniques."</p><p>She further claimed: "When this Court restricted&nbsp;the parties' ability to use corporal punishment on the children pendente lite and ordered the Defendant to participate in the children's therapy and counseling, he lashed out at this Court in such a way that he was admonished with possible contempt for any future outbursts."&nbsp;</p><p>Melody also defended the fact that she served him with a trespass notice.</p><p>She wrote: "The Defendant arrived at her house at night, unannounced and without permission in November 2021."</p><p>The U.S. Sun has reached out to Melody and Martell's attorneys for comment.</p><h2><strong>STRICT ORDER</strong></h2><p>In March 2023, an <a href=#>Alabama</a> judge signed off on an order after both parties battled it out in trial.</p><p>The judge wrote in the order obtained by The U.S. Sun: "During the current trial, this Court has found the testimony of both parents to be less than genuine.</p><p>"Each parent can only recall testimony in their favor but are evasive in other respects."</p><p>The judge further stated that Martell "has made positive strides and is placing his children's best interest first."</p><p>The former couple was ordered by the judge, per the filings, to "enroll and complete a conflict resolution class."</p><p>Martell and Melody were also ordered to "continue their joint custodial agreement," meaning Martell was denied his request for sole physical custody.</p><p>In addition, they were told that they must notify each other if either parent is traveling out of town or out of state with the children.</p><p>Plus, Melody was ordered to provide her contact info "immediately" since the judge found that the OWN star demonstrated "an inability to co-parent" given her excess "blocking" of the kids' father.</p><p>One interesting note the judge included is that their four kids "SHALL NOT participate or be filmed for television or any other social media platform" without getting permission from the court or until the children are of legal age, which is 19 in the state of Alabama.</p><img

previously reported news that <a href=#>Martell had filed for bankruptcy</a> in 2020, admitting to owing creditors up to $1million.</p><p>In the court documents, exclusively obtained by The U.S. Sun, Martell indicated that he owed less than 50 creditors between $1million to $10million.</p><p>The creditors he listed included: ex Melody, American Express, Capital One, Lowe's, Home Depot and the IRS.</p><p>The case was eventually terminated in August 2021.</p><p>Separately, Martell and Melody had both filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy with their business, Holt & Holt Entrepreneurship LLC, in March 2021.</p><p>Martell made his <a href=#>debut on RHOA</a> last month after Sheree introduced him to the <a href=#>Real Housewives</a> cast.</p><p>The star explained to viewers that she met Martell through a mutual friend and said that she sees him on weekends since he lives in Alabama.</p><p>"We really enjoy each other's company," she gushed at the time.</p><p>"Despite what you see on TV, he's never shown me anything but respect and I'm really happy that I didn't give up on love, that I left the door open."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The
