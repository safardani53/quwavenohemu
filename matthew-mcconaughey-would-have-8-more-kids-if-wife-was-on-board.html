Not a rebranding phase, an un-branding phase.&nbsp;By being away, by un-branding, then all of a sudden, things came to me that I was wanting to do. Dramatic roles that I’d been pursuing that weren’t coming my way.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Camila-Alves-and-Matthew-McConaughey-More-Kids.jpg><p>The producer added, “Then I went on a run with&nbsp;<i>Killer Joe</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mud</i>,&nbsp;<i>Magic Mike</i>. I got ahold of&nbsp;<i>Dallas Buyers Club</i>, but no one wanted to make it with me. Then we made that. For about 11 years I’ve been on a run that I’ve been enjoying.”</p><p><a href=#>McConaughey and Alves wed in June 201</a>2 at their home in Austin, Texas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKaanKeelsKotMSyZLCnpaGxbrTAr5xmcF2ivLOxjKSgnatdnrNuw8ifnGavkah6sLqMm6aaqpRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chuck-kohler-indiana-baby-box-firefighter.html><span>←</span><span>Indiana Firefighter Finds Second Newborn in Station's 'Baby Box'</span></a>
