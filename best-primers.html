Prone to oiliness? Opt for a product that's going to mattify and reduce shine. Notice your skin flaking? Hydration is the key for the smoothest base.</p><p>Before choosing your primer, it's worth also thinking about why you'll be wearing it. Will you be wearing heavy foundation over the top, or is it for day-to-day use?</p><p>Or if you're feeling like you don't want to wear any foundation, primers can also be a great product to wear on their own to smooth and even out texture.</p><p>This might sound like a fair amount to consider but don't worry, we're on hand to help. We've tried some of the best primers out there for different skin types so you can find your perfect match.</p><h2>Best primers at a glance:</h2><h2>1. Charlotte Tilbury Invisible UV Flawless Poreless Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1690.jpg><ul><li><strong>Charlotte Tilbury Invisible UV Flawless Poreless Primer, £40 from Charlotte Tilbury - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This may not surprise the beauty fans out there but the Invisible UV Flawless Poreless Primer from Charlotte Tilbury is very good.</p><p>A true mixture of skincare and makeup, the real selling point of this base is the SPF50 because, as most of us probably know by now, there's nothing more important than SPF when it comes to keeping our skin healthy and looking fresh. Whatever the weather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1691.jpg><p>It sits comfortably on the skin and allows liquid and cream foundations to glide smoothly without catching or dragging.</p><p>As with a number of Charlotte Tilbury products, this primer contains skincare favourite hyaluronic acid, so you can expect your skin to look and feel hydrated.</p><p>Add its ability to smooth out pores and keep makeup put, and you've got a product that is perfect for skin in need of a moisture boost.</p><p><strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p><h2>2. Pixi Flawless Beauty Primer<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1699-e1644401388123.jpg></h2><ul><li><strong>Pixi Flawless Beauty Primer, £24 from M&S - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If radiant skin is your jam then let us introduce you to the Flawless Beauty Primer from Pixi.</p><p>This one is all about creating even, glowing skin. When you squeeze it out of the tube, you can immediately see how reflective the rose gold liquid is, although it does settle down as you blend it in.</p><p>You don't need much: just a small blob on the five points of the face which you can blend in with fingers or a brush.</p><p>Aside from its radiant properties, it is sophisticated, boosting and protecting the skin by using skincare stalwarts.</p><p>Salicylic acid does what it does best, clearing pores and reducing blemishes while shea butter nourishes and soothes.</p><p>This sits nicely underneath foundation but do expect your whole face to glow so have some powder handy to set the central parts of the face for more subtlety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1700.jpg><p>As we've come to expect from Pixi products, this primer really works, although this one is best for combination and drier skin because the glow is likely to prove too much for oilier skin types.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p><h2>3. Glossier Futuredew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1692.jpg><ul><li><strong>Glossier Futuredew, £23 from Glossier - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Glossier gets a lot of hype. And with its millennial pink packaging and clean looking products, we can see why.</p><p>This one isn't technically marketed as a primer but we love the glow it gives us when we use it under foundation.</p><p>Packed full of nourishing and hydrating ingredients, like sugarcane squalane and evening primrose, you'll immediately notice skin is more hydrated and, well, glossier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1693.jpg><p>Although this is oil based, it doesn't break down foundation and instead creates a 'glow from within' finish which is especially good in the summer.</p><p>And, if these are on your makeup checklist, the Futuredew is also vegan and cruelty free. Tick and tick.</p><p>Put a little on after moisturiser and before your makeup for glowing skin.</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>3.5/5</strong></p><h2>4. <strong>Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1697-e1644401796258.jpg><ul><li><strong>Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer, from £17 at Cult Beauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This primer does exactly what it says it will do; it grips on to your foundation for dear life. Trust us.</p><p>We've tested this so you don't have to - always wash your makeup off before you go to sleep folks - but just in case, we know that massaging this liquid/gel hybrid in to your skin will keep your foundation in place for at least 24 hours.</p><p>It feels incredibly hydrating as it goes on but soon becomes tacky which means it's time to apply your foundation and let the hydro-grip work its magic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1698.jpg><p>Of all the primers on this list, this is the one to go for if you know you're going to need your foundation, CC cream or whichever base you use to stay put.</p><p>Expect no sliding or creasing from this Gen-Z approved product as well as genuinely hydrated skin.</p><p>There are two sizes of this one available, a mini 10ml tube for £17 or the full size 45ml for £31.</p><p><strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p><h2>5. Estee Lauder Double Wear Flawless Hydrating Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1695.jpg><ul><li><strong>Estee Lauder Double Wear Flawless Hydrating Primer, £31 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p>Double Wear is the creme-de-la-creme of Estee Lauder's makeup offerings and includes a sheer foundation that we included in our <a href=# rel=noopener>best foundations</a> roundup because we loved it that much.</p><p>The primer is just as good. It's lightweight and blends smoothly over skin to create an even and hydrated base to apply foundation onto.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1696.jpg><p>Double Wear is oil-free which is good news for those of you with oily or combination skin because it adds moisture without creating extra unwanted shine.</p><p>This one isn't for creating matte skin though, it still allows some dewiness for a natural looking finish and if you err on the side of dryness this won't aggravate it, instead this primer soothes and hydrates.</p><p>To top it all off, it has SPF 45 built in so if you forget to apply your actual SPF you've got that extra layer of protection.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4.5/5</strong></p><h2>6. e.l.f Cosmetics Poreless Putty Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/download-6.png><ul><li><strong>e.l.f Cosmetics Poreless Putty Primer, £9 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you've ever been on TikTok and the algorithm has decided you've got even the vaguest interest in beauty, you'll likely have seen the e.l.f Poreless Putty Primer.</p><p>It's a smoothing, balm like texture that's easy to distribute over clean skin for a flawless finish. Apply after moisturising - and SPF during the day - and feel the moisture lock in. Although it mattifies to smooth out pores it's infused with Squalane to hydrate and make sure your make-up stays in place all day.</p><p>Best used with liquid foundations rather than powders because of its balmy texture, you'll be searching for your pores because of how perfecting it is.</p><p>At less than £10, it really lasts and is the perfect primer for a matte, flawless make-up.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p><h2>7. Pat McGrath Labs Sublime Perfection Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.selfridges.com/is/image/selfridges/1143-3006535-36018036_M><ul><li><strong>Pat McGrath Labs Sublime Perfection Primer, £45 from Selfridges - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you're picking up a product from Pat McGrath, you can be fairly certain that it's going to fast become one of your favourites.</p><p>The Perfection Primer fits that mould, no problem. Formulated to smooth and refine, this beauty base if full of hydrating hyaluronic acid to ensure the skin doesn't dry out which, in turn, will leave your foundation look even smoother.</p><p>It's a creamy liquid texture that you can apply using your fingers or a brush and the silky primer locks your base in all day for a supple and delicate finish.</p><p>It's a little pricier at £45, but Pat McGrath products really are worth the money. We'd be very surprised if you wore this primer and didn't get comments on how great your skin looked because that's how good it is.</p><p>We love it.</p><p><strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p><h2>8. L'Oreal Paris Infallible Mattifying Primer Base</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FR15279-INFAILLIBLE-PRIMER.png><ul><li><strong>L'Oreal Paris Infallible Mattifying Primer Base, £9.99 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>L'Oreal Paris is a proper high street staple; they always offer high quality products at super affordable prices.</p><p>The Infallible Mattifying Primer is the brand's first gel primer and is a great one for oily skin because - as the name suggests - it mattifies so you won't be battling against shine.</p><p>Foundation can often be difficult to get right with oily skin because so many are liquid or cream based which can turn shiny or slide around throughout the day.</p><p>But pop on a layer of this base after moisturiser and before foundation to soak up any unwanted shine and keep your makeup in place.</p><p>It creates a thin layer over the surface of the skin to reduce the appearance of pores - it's worth noting the size of pores never change physically so we really do just mean the appearance - for a velvet finish.</p><p>For £9.99, you can't really go wrong.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p><h2>9. Trinny London Miracle Blur</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MiracleBlurWithShadowOnWhite-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Trinny London Miracle Blur, £26 from Trinny London - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>You might remember Trinny Woodall from a number of popular tv shows, but the former presenter is now the owner of a hugely successful cosmetics brand in Trinny London.</p><p>With the focus leaning towards more mature skin, Miracle Blur works to reduce the appearance of lines by smoothing and blurring skin texture.</p><p>This isn't one to be slathered all over your face because it is about targeting areas that need the extra help, for example, under eyes or wrinkles around lips.</p><p>Aside from blurring out lines, it also reduces shine so it's a good one for oilier skin or if you're planning to be in front of any camera flashes.</p><p>It's quite a small pot but we reckon if you use it daily it should last about six weeks.</p><p><strong>Rating: 3/5</strong></p><h2>10. YSL Touche Eclat Blur Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/YSL-Beauty_Touche-Eclat-Blur-Primer.jpg><ul><li><strong>YSL Touche Eclat Blur Primer, £32 from Look Fantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Okay, we've all heard of Touche Eclat right?</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Illuminating Pen</a> is possibly one of the most well known makeup products out there and this primer is from the same range so expectations were understandably high.</p><p>It didn't disappoint.</p><p>It's a liquid consistency that feels a lot like a serum and delicately glides over skin, reducing the appearance of pores while also giving skin a luminous boost.</p><p>Just like the original Touche Eclat Illuminating Pen, this primer is all about radiance and flawlessness whether you use it under foundation or on its own.</p><p>You don't need much, just one pump, and you can apply with fingers or a brush, we'll leave that choice up to you.</p><p>Leave it to sink in for ten seconds if you're applying foundation for the best results or just let it work its magic on its own.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p><h2>11. Benefit The POREfessional Lite Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/13490276-1304916424151053.jpg><ul><li><strong>Benefit The POREfessional Lite Primer, £29.50 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Benefit is known for two things in particular - brows and primer.</p><p>This offering is their newest primer launch, bringing an even lighter dimension to Benefit's incredibly popular <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">POREfessional primer</a>.</p><p>It's still a mousse texture but now contains glycerin for an ultra-light, hydrating finish.</p><p>The best thing is how well it smoothes out skin and it is absolutely a product that can be worn on its own.</p><p>Don't use too much though which can be the trap with products that aren't a liquid, just squeeze a small amount on to the back of your hand and blend out with a brush.</p><p>You can use your fingers if you'd rather but we think a brush gives a cleaner finish with this one.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4.5/5</strong></p><h2>12. Kevyn Aucoin Sensual Skin Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/12536780-7244897454314260.jpg><ul><li><strong>Kevyn Aucoin Sensual Skin Primer, £33 from Cult Beauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Makeup lovers know all about Kevyn Aucoin because it never misses.</p><p>If you're yet to come across the brand that was created by the eponymous founder who was responsible for creating the sculpted look of the 90s then it is our pleasure to introduce you.</p><p>Kevyn Aucoin's mission was always to enhance natural beauty and he worked his magic on icons like Elizabeth Taylor and the original supermodels.</p><p>So it's not too much of a surprise that the Sensual Skin Primer feels lightweight and luxurious when it's on.</p><p>The creamy formula smoothes out pores and creates a hydrating layer for foundation to sit on top of. Or wear it alone for a naturally flawless finish.</p><p>Hyaluronic acid plumps and moisturises while antioxidants do their job protecting the skin from external aggressors - think pollution and the like.</p><p>We're a big fan of this brand and this primer because if it's good enough for Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford then it's good enough for us.</p><p><strong>Rating: 4.5/5</strong></p><h2>What is primer?</h2><p>Primer is the foundation before the foundation. It's a mousse, liquid or cream product that sits on the skin and will either calm shine or boost radiance depending on the product you choose and your skin type.</p><h2>What does makeup primer do?</h2><p>If you notice your foundation sliding around or creasing, primer will fix that. As well as acting as a building block for the rest of your makeup it normally smoothes out skin, reduces the appearance of pores and can sometimes work as extra skincare with many options including staples like hyaluronic acid.</p><h2>How to apply primer</h2><p>Primer comes after your skincare but before your makeup. It's the in-between that links the two together and you'd normally apply it after moisturising.</p><p>You can apply with fingers or a brush depending on the consistency of the product, but generally using your fingers is a great way to massage into skin.</p><h2>What is the best primer?</h2><p>There's no one-size-fits-all answer for this one because it all depends on your skin type and what you're hoping to get from your primer.</p><p>Looking for something that's going to keep your makeup in place no matter what? Milk is the one to go for.</p><p>Struggle with very oily skin? Then check out L'Oreal Paris' Infallible primer.</p><p>All of the primer's on this list are excellent, so it's up to you to decide which one fits what you're specifically looking for.</p><h2>Where to buy makeup primer?</h2><p>Everywhere you'd normally get your makeup. All of the usual beauty suspects like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LookFantastic</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cult Beauty</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Boots</a> stock a range of primers and brands as do department stores like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">M&S</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">John Lewis</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harrods</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Selfridges</a>.</p><p>When it comes to primers, the world is your oyster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpsY26CdX6WaJmeq6RivbO1zJ6prGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-hanssen-children.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Robert Hanssen's Children?
