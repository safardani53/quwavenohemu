To do this, head to "Options > Roster > Title Management" to find the belts and assign them to the wrestler who earned them.</p><p>Jumping into a match after following these steps with this wrestler still won't show the double title entrance, regardless of which game mode. To fix this, you must find the "Edit Superstars" option under the "Roster" menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From here, locate the wrestler with the two equipped titles and scroll down to "Main Manager." According to YouTube creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TWINdaMOGUL</a>, swapping your manager with another makes the double title entrance work properly.</p><p>Although, the YouTuber makes it clear that his way is something he found and isn't sure if there are better methods.

Wow. Underwhelming, lazy," said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Reddit user</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another Reddit poster</a> expressed their frustrations about 2K Games not wanting to add "different double title entrance options" to the series rather than sticking with bare-bones versions.</p><p>The only highlight of this is that women superstars also have double title entrances, as shown on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. It helps even the playing field between male and female wrestlers in the virtual game but also suffers from the same limitations.</p><p>Regardless, being able to walk in with your two hard-earned championship belts is still a treat to see.</p><p>WWE 2K23 is now available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGKxsMHBpZxmrJmpuaZ5xKerq5memLJuw9aeZGujYmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dylan-meyer.html><span>←</span><span>Dylan Meyer Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Movies, Career</span></a>
