While we loved her red carpet ensemble, her after-party look was even better. She arrived at the CAA (Creative Artists Industry) party at Sunset Tower Hotel with her boyfriend, <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong>, 28, when she opted to wear a sparkly black skintight midi dress. The long-sleeve black <strong>Alexandre Vauthier</strong> dress hugged her toned frame perfectly and was completely ruched, while the front of hem of the dress was much shorter than the back, revealing her long, toned legs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The bodice of the dress was tight and featured a high mock-neck while the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>entire frock</a> was covered in sparkles and crystals. She topped her look off with a pair of bedazzled black flat loafers and diamond stud earrings. As for her glam, she chose to clip her blonde hair back into a half-up half-down style with her hair down in beachy waves and her bangs out in front of her face. A bold red lip and a sultry smokey eye done by makeup artist<strong> Lorrie Turk</strong>, tied her look together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Taylor absolutely slayed both of her looks for the evening and her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red carpet look</a> was truly amazing. She opted to wear a custom <strong>Etro Couture</strong> navy silk jacquard floral print ball gown with a keyhole cutout on the bodice, revealing her toned abs. The gorgeous sleeveless blue dress was covered in massive neon green flowers, while a long train cascaded behind her. She accessorized her look with a pair of <strong>Christian Louboutin</strong> pumps and dazzling <strong>Lorraine Schwartz</strong> jewels including her blue diamond dangling earrings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-golden-globes-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>We loved both of Taylor’s dresses from the Golden Globes and we can’t decide which one we liked better!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ye49vZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2XuaKvymaqqZmioLm6ecOrnKyrXZy8rbDEp2SgpJ%2BXsrR5wJ%2Brnqpdpa6zwNhmpq6slp7BbrzInKpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-things-i-hate-about-you-cast-then-and-now-photos-4361466.html><span>←</span><span>See Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
