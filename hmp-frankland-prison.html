hospital</a>.</p><p><a href=#>The Yorkshire Ripper</a> was serving 20 concurrent life sentences at the time of his death and had been denied an appeal in 2010 meaning he would never be

Pitchfork</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PRISONS-Pitchfork-12171038jpg-JS657863725.jpg><p><a href=#>Colin Pitchfork</a> was the <a href=#>first person convicted of

approaching women when on walks.</p><h3>John Straffen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NWF18EVIL16A-JS1075694.jpg><p>One of the longest serving prisoner in British history, John Straffen, was incarcerated for

for <a href=#>killing Lin, 45, and her daughter Megan Russell</a> as well as the attempted murder of <a href=#>Josie Russell</a>.</p><p>Stone has maintained his innocence and contests his conviction, with his legal team pointing to Levi Bellfield as a possible suspect.</p><p>As recently as February 2022, The Sun revealed that <a href=#>Bellfield had confessed to the brutal murders</a>.</p><p>This would mean that Stone was wrongfully convicted and could result in his freedom.</p><h3>Ian Huntley</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-2806144jpg-JS304783086jpg-JS604457338-e1651136603986.jpg><p>Soham murderer <a href=#>Ian Huntley</a> was

<a href=#>Lee Rigby</a> probably will be.</p><p><a href=#>Rigby</a> was returning to his barracks after working at the Tower of London in May 2013, when he was hit by a car and attacked with knives and a meat cleaver.</p><p>The gruesome killing earned Adebolajo a whole-life tariff, he later confessed and <a href=#>expressed regret for his actions</a>.</p><p>In 2021, his accomplice <a href=#>Michael Adebowale</a> was taken from Broadmoor to a hospital, suffering from <a href=#>Covid</a> and needing oxygen.</p><h3>Wayne Couzens</h3><img

September of that year.</p><p>Couzens was back in the dock in April 2022 for <a href=#>four counts of indecent exposure</a> from February 2021.</p><p>The case against Couzens triggered <a href=#>vigils and protests</a> across the UK.</p><p>A particularly <a href=#>upsetting vigil in London</a> saw the Met police acting heavy handed with the grieving women present, which the <a href=#>High Court ruled as a breach</a> in the protestors' rights.</p><p class=postsid
