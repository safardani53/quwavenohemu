Propping up the 11th-tier Wearside League, the Citizens have shipped a ridiculous 128 goals and scored just two in 13 games.
With an embarrassing ONE win since 2019, furious fans are demanding Bernard sell up.
But the Frenchman is having none of it, firing back: “Durham City doesn’t have ANY real supporters.”
Granted, less than a dozen watched last Saturday’s perfectly normal 10-0 battering by FC Hartlepool."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
