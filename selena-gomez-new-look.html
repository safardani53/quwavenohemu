Now that Selena is back, along with Steve Martin and Martin Short, for the third season of <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a>, some people who don't normally pay attention to Selena are seeing her for the first time in a while.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And, while not all of those people are hardcore fans, some have noticed that Selena looks a little bit different than they remember her looking when she was a little younger, and are wondering why that is. Here's what we know about Selena's new look.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's behind Selena Gomez's new look?</h2><p>In the comments people have left, most of them are simply asking questions, wondering why Selena's face seems different to them from what they remember.</p><p>"I don't know if it's just me but she looks very different to the Selena Gomez we know growing up," one person wrote above an update from one of their recent posts, while others have added that her eyes seem smaller.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although small differences in a person's face may not seem like a very big deal, people were certainly curious whether these changes were the result of aging, plastic surgery, or something else.</p><p>As it turns out, the changes in Selena's face may be due to lupus, a condition she first revealed that she had been diagnosed with back in 2015. Although lupus itself doesn't necessarily change your appearance, the drugs you take to treat it can give you a puffy face.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Yes. It happens to lupus patients. Especially since we take prednisone. It causes moon face," one person wrote in response to a comment about Selena's changing appearance.</p><p>Of course, a person's face also changes as they age, so it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that Selena doesn't look the way she did at 16. The more recent changes, though, seem to be the result of her treatment for lupus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Selena has addressed how medications have changed her appearance.</h2><p>Although it's definitely not information fans should have to know, Selena has been pretty open about how her medications have changed her appearance. She explained that one of the medications she's on causes her to hold a lot of water weight.</p><p>‚ÄúI just wanted to‚Ä¶ encourage anyone out there who feels any sort of shame for exactly what they‚Äôre going through, and no one knows the real story,‚Äù she added on a TikTok livestream.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't know if it's just me but she looks very different to the Selena Gomez we know growing up <a href=#>https://t.co/CkWigQdF4b</a></p>‚Äî Major-General PepperüéñÔ∏è (@theodox_dip) <a href=#>July 30, 2023</a></figure><p>Medications like prednisone can lead to shift in how the body stores fat, and while those changes may be jarring when you're incredibly famous, Selena has learned how to take them in stride.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, we have days where maybe we feel like s--t, but I would much rather be healthy and take care of myself. My medications are important, and I believe they‚Äôre what helps me," Selena said on her livestream.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbrrEsGSlp5%2Bg</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-lovato-then-and-now-transformation-photos.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Photos Of Their Transformation Hollywood Life</span></a>
