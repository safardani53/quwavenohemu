Teresa who’s known for her hot temper and table-flipping abilities (yes, we were gifted with a flashback scene of that beautiful moment on the new episode), made sure that everyone knew she’s focused on family over everything else.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I used to have a hot Italian temper,” Teresa says, adding that she wants to teach her children not to react to others who push their buttons.&nbsp;“Through this legal issue we’re dealing with, I’m just a mom.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Teresa and Joe tell their girls that their “sisterly bond” should stay strong forever, but Teresa couldn’t help but to shed a few tears. (She must be thinking of her potential future — in jail.)</p><h3>Nicole Pulls Out Amber’s Hair In Major Cat-Fight</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>While Teresa and Joe were focusing on the kids, <strong>Nicole&nbsp;Napolitano&nbsp;</strong>was pulling out&nbsp;<strong>Amber Marchese&nbsp;</strong>hair.&nbsp;At Bobby’s (Nicole’s boyfriend) first responder costume party, the ladies showed up in full life-saver garb — sexy firefighters, pleather bodysuits and&nbsp;<strong>Dina Manzo</strong>‘s unsexy scrubs to deflect her blind date (gotta love her).</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Unfortunately, the housewives’ slutty Halloween costumes weren’t the focus of the night. And either was “Jimmy James”&nbsp;— even though he did spark a fight with&nbsp;<strong>Melissa Gorga</strong>‘s husband, which we’ll have to wait until next week to see in action.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Melissa had heard from Amber that Nicole broke up a family, and the aftermath wasn’t pretty. Nicole pulled Amber’s hair, drinks were thrown and F-bombs were unleashed. Seriously, Nicole literally pulled out Amber’s hair — and Jim held onto a giant clump of it, after the fight. For extra ammo, he threw it onto the kitchen counter where the housewife husbands were having some peaceful guy time. (Not for long.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Thank god for the housewives — they make us all feel so normal.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, whose side are you on in this fight — Team Amber or Team Nicole?
