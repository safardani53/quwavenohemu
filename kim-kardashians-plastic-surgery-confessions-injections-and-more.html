It’s not easy when you’re a mom and you’re exhausted at the end of the day or you’re in school and I’m all of the above. I do my beauty treatments usually late at night. After everyone’s in bed, I’m doing laser treatments.”</p><p>Despite her candor about how much appearance matters to her, Kardashian has <a href=#>refuted certain plastic surgery rumors</a> over the years. “I never had my nose done,” the reality television star revealed while getting her makeup done during the February 2019 Masterclass by <a href=#><strong>Mario Dedivanovic</strong></a>. “Everyone thought I did, and I said wait until I have kids because your real features come out.”</p><p>The SKIMS CEO further denied making any changes to her face, <a href=#>besides Botox</a>, during her 2022 Allure interview. “I’ve never had eyelash extensions. I’ve never done anything. I have a drop of mascara on today. I’ve never filled my cheeks. I’ve never filled my lips,” she told the outlet.</p><p>Kardashian added that she’d shied away from <a href=#>cosmetic procedures</a> that would make her unrecognizable. “I’m 41. I always want to look appropriate. There does come a point when you’ve taken it too far — overfilled, too tight, too much cosmetic work. There’s nothing worse,” she said.</p><p>Despite the California native’s reluctance to undergo certain procedures, she’s willing to try unconventional methods to look her best. In March 2013, she shared a bloody Instagram selfie after getting a <a href=#>“vampire facial,”</a> which combines microdermabrasion with a mask of platelet-rich plasma.</p><p>Kardashian later admitted that the experience was uncomfortable during a 2018 post on her website. “It was honestly the most painful thing ever! It’s the one treatment that I’ll never do again,” she shared at the time.</p><p>Though unwilling to don a mask of her own blood a second time, the socialite made headlines in June 2022 for <a href=#>revealing just how far she would go</a> to stay young.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If you told me that I literally had to eat poop every single day and I would look younger, I might,” Kardashian told The New York Times. “I just might.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the beauty guru’s plastic surgery confessions over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKoqRmo5GnsaK%2Fx6KYp6tdpbmiv9Oimmarpae0pr7YZpqoppaawLS1zqeqZqGen7KkwMiopaxlkaOxbrnOq5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eiza-gonzalez-pics-liam-hemsworth-flirting-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Is She The One Who Broke Up Miley Cyrus &amp;amp; Liam Hemsworth?
