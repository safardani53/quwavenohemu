However, the show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gained a cult following</a> and slowly became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>Celebrities such as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Lady Gaga</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ariana Grande</strong> </a>have appeared as guest judges on the show, which moved from Logo to VH1 in 2017. The critically acclaimed series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has won 13 Emmys,</a> including two wins for Best Reality Competition Series and four wins <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for Best Reality Host.</a> The Drag Race empire has even expanded into international versions in Canada, Thailand and the U.K.</p><p>Although RuPaul’s Drag Race is known for delivering sickening lip-synchs and meme-worthy feuds, the show has also spotlighted issues such as mental health, heartbreak and self-doubt. Even though the queens can be vulnerable on camera, the contestants make it clear that they are there to win.</p><p>“Nine out of 10 of the people who audition for our show, they’ll say these words — and it’s funny ’cause we all laugh every time we hear it — they say, ‘Honey, I will cut a bitch,’” RuPaul told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> in 2017.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The queens have taken </a>that winning mentality with them into their post-Drag Race careers.</p><p><strong>Trixie Mattel</strong> (All Stars 3) and <strong>Katya</strong> (All Stars 2) joined forces to create a drag comedy empire after meeting on season 7. The pals released their acclaimed web series, UNHhhh, in 2016 followed by their short-lived Viceland series, The Trixie & Katya Show, one year later. The queens are also the cohosts of Netflix’s web commentary series I Like to Watch, which premiered in 2019. Mattel and Katya released their book, Trixie and Katya’s Guide to Modern Womanhood, in 2020, which landed them on the New York Times Best Sellers List.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Past contestants are sometimes invited back to compete for the crown on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars.
