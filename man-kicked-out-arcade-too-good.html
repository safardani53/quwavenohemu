Source: TikTok / @clawcraziness5We've all played our fair share of claw machines, and almost every time, we leave empty-handed. No matter how many times we try to win, we just can't get the claw to grab the prize.
On the other hand, some people are able to walk away with the most expensive prizes."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

You can't play this [anymore]." OK, do these owners just hate to see people win?!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@clawcraziness5 href=#>@clawcraziness5</a><p>Kicked Out of This Arcade For Winning Keymaster</p><a title="♬ original sound - Claw Craziness" href=#>♬ original sound - Claw Craziness</a></figure><p>"My dad ended up stopping the camera out of just like pure confusion, but [the owner] grabbed my lens, [took] my camera away, and proceeded to throw us out of the bowling alley for no reason at all," the TikToker added. "He just said we can't play it anymore [and] we have to leave. He followed us out of the bowling alley, extremely angry, and we never came back to this day."</p><p>The claw machine expert and his father then went to a Round 1 arcade, where they encountered another yet annoyed employee. While playing a game, the worker rushed over and told them, "Just so you guys know, you're not allowed to record here. So, I need you to delete that right now."</p><p>Generally speaking, private businesses have the right to ask customers not to record on their turf. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Round1 house rules</a> even say they "reserve the right to revoke permission to film or take photos at any time for any reason."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @zalicoh</span></figure><p>Many fellow TikTokers took to the video's comment section, claiming that employees weren't mad that the creator was winning; they were annoyed because he was recording his experiences.</p><p>"Sadly, it is a private, business so they can kick you out for no reason or deny recording," one user said.</p><p>Another TikToker wrote, "Seems like the problem they have is you recording, not winning."</p><p>"Not cause you're winning, cause you're recording lmao," a third user penned.</p><p>A fourth person commented, "I can only assume they think you're recording for exploiting those games."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @bronco_man71</span></figure><p>Others, however, believe the creator was, in fact, kicked out for winning.</p><p>"They don't like people winning," said one TikToker.</p><p>A second person claimed, "If you were losing, they would never have an issue with you playing," while a third joked that the owner probably thought, "This machine is for me to take your money, not for you to win."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vecqimqSdlGK8tsCMmqmcmZSaerW7zmaeqKeU</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brent-smiths-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Brent Smith Dating Brent Smith's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
