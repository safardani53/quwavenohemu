dumping ground for films where often the ones that should have got away are re­leased to the masses.</strong></p><p>So it seems quite the treat that we are handed a quirky and laugh-out-loud horror in the shape of the doll-that-never-sleeps, M3GAN.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2khpyfj-m3gan-787839932.jpg><p>The film opens with a commercial selling a pet that “never dies”, unlike pesky real pets — the Furby.</p><p>It’s an annoying interactive robot animal that kids are hooked on taking care of.</p><p>Its inventor is Gemma (Allison Williams) — an independent, single workaholic whose life is thrown into disarray when she becomes the legal guardian of her 12-year-old niece Cady (Violet McGraw).</p><p>Cady has been left broken by the sudden death of both her parents.</p><p>Gemma has lived a life of glasses on coasters and collecting Japanese toys still in their boxes.</p><p>She does not know how to cope with Cady so she does what any worried aunt would do.</p><p>She creates an artificial intelligence doll — one that moves, speaks and understands human emotions — to bring her up.</p><p>The unnervingly realistic robot is called M3GAN and soon becomes Cady’s best friend and confidante.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Film</h2></p><p>While she is deeply creepy, M3GAN isn’t all bad at first.</p><p>Having taught Cady how to use a coaster and flush the loo, she is fiercely loyal to the little girl.</p><p>Which means destroying anything that upsets her.</p><p>Director Gerard Johnstone creates an almost lovable demon in the form of M3GAN, with her evil ways having vaguely good intentions — and you have to admire the fact she can do a really chilling side-eye.</p><p>When Gemma tries to remove M3GAN from Cady after a malfunction that has clearly turning the droid into a serial killer, her niece’s response is one that many parents have endured when banning screen time.</p><p>There’s screaming, violence, rage and begging — and with it the eerie reminder we don’t know the full extent of the damage we’re doing when we pass little hands technology.</p><p>This may be one of the most terrifying realisations during this film, which never quite gets to the heart of horror.</p><p>There are a few jumps and silly slayings, but not enough gore to keep you awake on these dark nights.</p><p>This living doll will, however, have you checking your kid’s iPad settings for a good while.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>TAR</h2><h3 class=has-text-align-center>(15) 157mins</h3><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★☆☆☆</span></h2><p>THERE is a great deal to admire about this story of fictional composer/conductor Lydia Tar, who sees her life and career unravel when accused of sexual misconduct and bullying.</p><p>The electrifying performance by <a href=#>Cate Blanchett</a> in the lead role is an acting masterclass and will quite possibly win her an Oscar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2m65cb2-tar-cate-blanchett-787841580.jpg><p>And the muted tones,­ ­stylish sets and excellent ensemble cast are all delicious to watch.</p><p>Yet in director Todd Field’s first time behind the camera since 2006’s Little Children, there’s a great deal to be incredibly frustrated by, too.</p><p>The pace is often painfully slow and frequently feels pretentious, with the first two hours lethargic.</p><p>Then, in the last 40 minutes it seems to accelerate as though it suddenly realises there’s a lot of story left to tell.</p><p>An early scene between Tar and fellow conductor Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong in a sad-looking wig) lasted so long I found myself hypnotised by whether Tar was going to eat a piece of buttered bread, rather than being able to absorb the incredibly chewy dialogue.</p><p><a href=#>Blanchett’s</a> brilliance papers over the cracks of this walking-through-treacle tale that hits a bum-numbing note. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>THE OLD WAY</h2><h3 class=has-text-align-center>(15) 95mins</h3><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★☆☆☆</span></h2><p>WATCHING a <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> movie in recent years is like a game of heads or tails.</p><p>Sometimes you win, as with Pig or The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sftw-taken-internet-787841824.jpg><p>Other times you lose, like with this utterly mediocre take on the Western.</p><p>From the moment an early close-up shows a short-lived character wearing some sort of Specsavers spectacles, it’s clear the film would be cutting corners – in quality and authenticity.</p><p>And no amount of Cage’s special sauce could elevate his reformed killer-turned-family-man Colton Briggs.</p><p>He’s on a mission for vengeance after his wife is murdered by a gang.</p><p>It’s a paint-by-numbers Western but Brett Donowho, directing a woeful script by Carl W. Lucas, could barely keep the colours within the lines.</p><p>The editing is jarring, the camerawork is sloppy and the heavy-handed dialogue boasts such eye rolling lines as “The dead ain’t selfish. I like the dead”.</p><p>The poor man’s True Grit relationship between Cage and on screen daughter Ryan Kiera Armstrong might be the film’s only redeeming quality.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The pair share a spark but it’s ultimately dampened by a tepid script and poor direction.</p><p><strong>Hanna Flint</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSEcn6PbmxpZ5SquaS1xGannpmimLJuuZKgmKdloprDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jodie-sweetin-almost-died-birth-daughter-beatrix.html><span>←</span><span>Jodie Sweetin Is Lucky To Be Alive!
