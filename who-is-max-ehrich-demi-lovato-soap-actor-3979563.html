The couple have only dated for a few months, and have been quarantined together since March.

The&nbsp;Young and the Restless&nbsp;star, 28, has only been linked to the “Confident” singer, 27, for a few weeks, but the pair are already <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>self-isolating</a> together amid the global <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>coronavirus outbreak</a>. Talk about getting to know your significant other&nbsp;super quickly! The adorable duo have been exchanging flirty comments on Instagram, and Max even took to his page to share a steamy shirtless photo. “when u realize u should’ve packed more for your quarantine stay have a blessed Monday filled with health, happiness, safety, joy, love, & laughter &lt;3,” he captioned the photo of himself. Demi quickly responded in his comments, writing: “Fine by me…” Here’s 5 things to know about the former Disney star’s new man!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/max-ehrich-dating-demi-lovato-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>1. He’s an actor.</strong> Max is well known for this role as Fenmore Baldwin on TV soap Young and the Restless. Since then, Max has proved he’s more than just a soap star, and has been in Under the Dome&nbsp;and&nbsp;American Princess. He also appeared on some of our favorite 2000s shows like Ugly Betty and&nbsp;iCarly.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>2. He’s also an amazing singer.</strong> Much like his flame, he can also sing. Max has proved he’s a man of many talents by posting videos to his Instagram account of himself singing. The hunky actor boasts more than one million followers on the social media site, and regularly posts clips which show off his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>impressive vocals.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3. Max is social distancing with Demi.</strong> Eagle-eyed fans noticed f<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lirty interactions</a> between the couple on social media, which indicated the pair are self-isolating together. On March 24, Max posted videos of himself snuggling with Demi’s pups Batman and Ella on Instagram Stories. He also began filming an Instagram Live when Demi walked into the frame, despite Max trying to warn her not to. When Demi realized Max was filming live on Instagram, she ran out of the shot laughing. Max was so flustered by the interaction he turned his camera off!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/demi-lovato-max-ehrich-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>4. The pair have only been dating for a few weeks.&nbsp;</strong>In an extremely bold move, the pair are quarantined together after just a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>few weeks of dating</a>. Max covered Mario’s “Let Me Love You,” in early March, posting it on Instagram with the caption, “to my &lt;3.” Demi commented on the post with the pleading eyes emoji and a heart, to which Max responded with, “❤️∞.” Too sweet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>5. Like Demi, he’s appeared on the Disney Channel.</strong> Max had a two episode arc on Shake It Up back in 2010 alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Zendaya </strong></a>and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Bella Thorne</strong></a>.
