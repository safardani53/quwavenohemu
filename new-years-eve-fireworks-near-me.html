If you're in the tri-state area, you can head to Coney Island for the fifth annual celebration, complete with fireworks (duh), a digital ball drop, and if you stick around, a Circus Sideshow Fire Spectacular at 1 a.m.&nbsp;</p><p>Brooklyn is also great spot to watch fireworks, thanks to the free NYE event at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospect Park</a>, which starts at 10:30 p.m. and ends with a major display at midnight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Christmas is over which means it's time to start making your NYE plans!

Spoiler alert: there is no alcohol permitted.&nbsp;</p><p>For a 21-and-up New Year's Eve experience, hop on board the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen Mary</a> where you can enjoy a fireworks show over the water, and keep the party going until the morning –&nbsp;and not have to worry about Ubering home.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chicago</h2><p>We have two words for you: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Navy Pier</a>. The fireworks show is sponsored by Miller Lite, so you know the sparkly display over Lake Michigan won't disappoint. The 15-minute show will begin promptly at midnight,&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Houston</h2><p>You don't have to spend any money to celebrate New Year's Eve in Houston. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CityCentre</a> is a popular spot for a free event, complete with live music, confetti, and a fireworks show at midnight. The festivities will kick off at 9:30 p.m.</p><p>If you have kids, and need to ring in the new year a bit earlier, we suggest heading to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kemah Boardwalk</a>, where a fireworks show is scheduled for 10 p.m.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Philadelphia</h2><p>There will be two fireworks displays over the Delaware River thanks to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SugarHouse New Year’s Eve Fireworks on the Waterfront</a> — one at 6 p.m. and another at midnight — just make sure you do a bit of research to find the perfect spot to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Another great choice: the Cherry Street Pier, which will be hosting their first annual NYE celebration. Tickets can be purchased <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">New Orleans</h2><p>Fireworks will be in the air above the river. &nbsp;Pro tip: take the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ferry</a> to Algiers Point to see the show against the city's skyline.&nbsp;</p><p>Or you can join Pretty Little Liars star Lucy Hale as she hosts Dick Clark's New Year’s Rockin’ Eve at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackson Square</a>, complete with live music and celebrity appearances.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Get your resolutions ready!

You can watch the display from Happiest Hour, which has a rooftop patio, or the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Red Museum </a>(tickets start at $75 and include dinner and dancing).&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">San Francisco</h2><p>The San Francisco Bay Bridge will make any fireworks display look better — and it's no surprise that thousands show up to watch between the Ferry Building and the SF Bay Bridge. Pro tip: get there around 7 p.m. to find a good viewing spot and bring snacks!&nbsp;</p><p>You can also watch from the water if you have a bigger budget thanks to some NYE cruise options, or head to a restaurant with a view, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterbar</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sens</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Seattle</h2><p>Another landmark that makes fireworks look even more magical: the Space Needle. Watch the show from the Seattle Center Armory, which will have a live dance band from 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Volunteer Park</a>, or jump on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ferry</a> to Bainbridge at 11:15 p.m. to watch from the water.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Washington D.C.&amp;#xA0;</h2><p>There is only one place to be on New Year's Eve in the nation's capital, and it's called Big Night D.C. Extravaganza. With seven dance floors, open bar, and a view of the fireworks over the Potomac from inside or the wrap-around balcony, &nbsp;it's a guaranteed good time. Get tickets <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nashville</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Daniel's Music City Midnight</a> is the New Year's Eve party in Nashville. With performances by Keith Urban, Peter Frampton, and more, the free outdoor celebration at &nbsp;Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park is a must-see. Oh, and there will be fireworks to ring in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Boston</h2><p>For New England's largest New Year's Eve celebration, head to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> First Night Boston</a> at Copley Square and Back Bay. The family-friendly fireworks show will start at 7 p.m. and there will be a midnight display over Boston Harbor — viewing available at North End and the Seaport — at midnight.&nbsp;</p><p>The event is entirely funded by local communities, so show your support!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Atlanta</h2><p>Forget the ball drop, it's all about the Peach Drop in the ATL. The event will return to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Underground Atlanta</a> and spectators can expect great musical performances along with fireworks at the day-long party.</p><p>Or you can head for an earlier fireworks show for the kids at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone Mountain Park</a> when the clock strikes 9 p.m.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Miami</h2><p>If Atlanta has the Peach Drop, then Miami definitely has the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Orange,</a> which goes up instead of drops. This year, the free celebration will take place at Bayfront Park and feature performances from Pitbull and his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Ocean Drive also has an impressive fireworks show at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lummus Park</a>. Pro tip: don't drive. The free trolleys will be running until 2 a.m. and this way, you won't have to worry about finding parking.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Las Vegas</h2><p>If you're in Sin City for New Year's Eve, there's no way you won't catch at least one fireworks show. Fireworks will go off from the rooftops of the Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood Resort, MGM Grand, Aria, TreasureIsland, The Venetian and Stratosphere, and there will also be a show at MonteLago Village.&nbsp;</p><p>The strip shuts down at 5 p.m. for a massive block party, and fireworks kick off at midnight.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYW18cn6Oa21oi2OZmI2Nsmilnq9drrKivtJmnK%2BdXZu2s7HWqKmkq12jsqK%2BjKac</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brendan-fletcher.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Brendan Fletcher net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
