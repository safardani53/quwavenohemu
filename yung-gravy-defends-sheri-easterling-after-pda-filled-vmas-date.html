The twosome <a href=#>turned heads as they packed on the PDA</a> — kissing for the cameras — while <a href=#>walking the red carpet in matching lavender ensembles</a>.</p><p>“We met online and we connected right away,” Gravy said during an interview with MTV’s <strong>Nessa Diab</strong> on Sunday. “You know, I’m from the furthest north it gets and she’s from the furthest south it gets. I’m into MILFs and she’s kind of the queen of MILFs, so I figured it was just the perfect match.”</p><p>Easterling’s romance with the “Always Saucy” musician came one month after news broke that her estranged husband, <strong>Monty Lopez</strong>, <a href=#>allegedly cheated on her during their marriage</a>. In July, a woman named <strong>Renée Ash</strong> claimed that she dated Lopez, 46, and that he lied about his marriage being over. (Lopez, for his part, did not publicly respond to the accusations.)</p><p>The social media star, for her part, addressed the news about her personal life via her Instagram Story that same month. Easterling — <a href=#>who shares Rae, 21, and sons Enzo, 14, and Luca, 8, with Lopez</a> — didn’t, however, directly speak about the alleged affair.</p><p>“Personal matters being brought public are always challenging and overwhelming for anyone involved,” the TikTok star said in July. ‘I will be OK. My biggest concern is — and always will be — my children and their fragile hearts and minds. I will always do my best to protect them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Easterling has since changed her Instagram bio to “single mom” and seemingly moved on with Gravy after flirting on social media last month.</p><p>Lopez, for his part, <a href=#>commented on his estranged wife’s new beau</a> via his Instagram Story on Sunday, claiming he is “Unbothered!” by the new romance. “Thank you @youngravy for taking the leftovers!” he wrote alongside a shirtless mirror selfie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGayrZ6ceqi%2BwK%2BwZpyVm7KvsNJmqqGdop56pq3SrZyrpJmjtG6txa2cq2Wgma5ussilo56cXau6or%2BMnZitnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ashlyne-huff-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Ashlyne Huff Dating Now</span></a>
