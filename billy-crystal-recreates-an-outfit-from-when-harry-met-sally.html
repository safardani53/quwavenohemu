In the side-by-side pictures, he squatted down in a pair of blue jeans, a fisherman sweater and white sneakers. Crystal beamed into the camera with a soft smile, just like he did over 33 years ago when the beloved movie premiered. The second photo in the tweet was a screenshot from the movie of the actor in a comfy knit sweater, and the same pose.</p><p>The Monsters Inc. actor shared the endearing pictures on his 75th birthday and captioned the post, “Thank you all..” Fans were quick to wish Crystal a “Happy Birthday” in his comments along with loving notes.</p><p>One wrote, “Love this! You’re so wonderful! Happy Birthday and many more! Thanks for all the <a href=#>great movies and Tv shows</a>.” Another added, “I love it when you get that little crinkle above your brow when you’re recreating a most memorable character from one of my favorite movies!”</p><p>A third commented, “Still looking good, kid!” More shared their own photos of them squatting in the same pose with similar outfits on.</p><p>The infamous pose came when Crystal, portraying the character Harry, unrolled a rug with costar <a href=#><strong>Meg Ryan</strong>,</a> who plays Sally, while the duo discussed their dating lives. Ryan, 61, for her part, wore a vibrant red knit sweater, black skirt, and tights at the time. Her hair was styled in <a href=#>voluminous waves</a> and she rocked <a href=#>light makeup.</a></p><p>At a <a href=#>2019 panel celebrating the 30th anniversary</a> of the movie, Crystal recalled auditioning with Ryan and gushed that he and director <strong>Rob Reiner</strong> kept “stealing looks at each other” because acting with the You’ve Got Mail star felt “amazing.” The director also added that “they connected right away.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to still being able to rock a pair of jeans, Crystal also looks super stylish in suits. At the 2023 Costume Designers Guild Awards last month, he​​ came <a href=#>dressed to impress in a lavish ensemble</a>. The Princess Bride actor paired a navy velvet jacket with an indigo button up, matching pants and lace-up dress shoes. His salt and pepper hair was neatly brushed back and he shaved his facial hair into a goatee.</p><p>Another fabulous fit the Analyze That actor wore came at the July 2022 Broadway Barks event. Crystal helped <a href=#>raise awareness for pets up for adoption</a> and even held a puppy in his arms. The New York native dressed a bit more casually for the soirée, but still looked just as handsome. He stunted a dark blue cotton shirt, white trousers, brown fedora and cool sunglasses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e2rbjYZpqrsaOprq150Z6aq52RqbK0ecCnZKitpJu2tXnFq6amZaedsq95x5qpq7FdorK1edKao6WxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./90-day-fiances-amanda-was-arrested-years-before-tv-fame-records-claim.html><span>←</span><span> 90 Day Fiancs Amanda was arrested years before TV fame, records claim Wed 16 August</span></a>
