Golfer <strong>Cameron Young</strong>’s relationship with his wife <strong>Kelsey Dalition</strong> has grown just as much as his professional career.</p><p>Born in Briarcliff Manor, New York, Cameron learned how to play golf at the Sleepy Hollow Country Club, where his dad, <strong>David Young</strong>, worked as the head golf professional. He went on to play for Wake Forest University in college before going pro in 2019. Though little is known about when he met his future wife, the athlete and Dalition <a href=#>tied the knot</a> when he was 23 years old in the early 2020s. His caddie at the time, <strong>Scott McKean</strong>, served as his best man at the ceremony.</p><p>Around that time, Cameron made his Korn Ferry Tour debut in July 2020 and won his first professional tournament at the <a href=#>Tour’s AdventHealth Championship</a>. Following another <a href=#>Korn Ferry Tour win</a>, he would earn his first PGA Tour card in 2021.</p><p>His personal and professional life continued to grow in 2022. Not only did he earn the title of <a href=#>PGA Tour Rookie of the Year</a> and make his Tour Championship and U.S. Presidents Cup team debuts, but he and Dalition became first-time parents with the birth of their son, Henry.</p><p>When it comes to major tournaments, Cameron made <a href=#>his Masters debut</a> in 2022. Coming off a second-place finish at the SGC-Dell Match Play tournament in Austin, Texas, the golf star returned to the Masters in April 2023 as one of the tournament’s favorites to win it all.</p><p>“I’ve been playing well. I feel like the result in Austin, I think, was more reflective of it than a lot of them before that, kind of early this season. But I feel like it’s been going the right direction, and [I’m] just excited to get the week started,” he said of his chances of winning the Masters in an interview with <a href=#>TenGolf</a> in April 2023.</p><p>Recalling his performance at last year’s Masters— at which he was cut — he continued: “I just didn’t play very well. I think this is a hard place to play for your first time, and I probably wasn’t as, nearly as prepared as far as golf course knowledge as I am this year. And I feel like I was just much less comfortable, generally, playing on the PGA tour and, you know, majors and <a href=#>the Masters</a>, than I am today. I feel like I’m much more comfortable being here.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also revealed that he learned a thing or two from his new caddie, <strong>Paul Tesori</strong>, who previously worked for former U.S. Open winner <strong>Webb Simpson</strong>. “His golf course knowledge is unbelievable,” Cameron said in the interview. “I think this is his 21st Masters. He’s still out there learning, which is unbelievable to me. I feel like every hole, he picks something out and gets a new number that he hasn’t had before. And his kind of attention to detail … he’s unbelievable just with noticing some of those little things and bringing my attention to them. So, he’s a tremendous resource for me, especially this week.’’</p><p>Scroll below for a timeline of Cameron and Dalition’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKK5xKump2WppMKvs4yapZ1lp56zpnnKnqOsnalisaK4yK2gqKajYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnToqSepJmjsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rose-burgundy-hazel-e-relationship-dating-happy-katt-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Why He Makes Her Happier Than Katt Williams Hollywood Life</span></a>
