We got a very, very quick glimpse at the pair to close the premiere and they seem to be living a normal life somewhere.</p><p>They were reading the newspaper. They were acting almost like a couple. They came across as anything but two people who were sucked away when The Other Side evaporated to close The Vampire Diaries Season 5. Intriguing.</p><p>CAROLINE is reacting to their presumed death by maintaining hope. She’s reading every book she can get her hands on to figure out a way to bring her friends back.</p><p>JEREMY is drinking a lot, playing video games and hooking up with random girls. What a life! Umm… we mean, he’s clearly having some issues.</p><p>MATT has joined some kind of Mystic Falls protection group that is led by someone named Tripp. He seems VERY interested in the supernatural.</p><p>STEFAN has gone off to Savannah and is barely speaking to anyone anymore. He’s hooking up with some girl named Ivy, but appears to be using her as a means to an important end: determining a way to get Damon back.</p><p>He tells Elena on the phone at one point that he’s given up hope and has said goodbye and she should do the same. But we don’t buy it.</p><p>TYLER is dealing with major rage issues, barely able to contain his temper now that he’s human again, with the werewolf curse still inside of him.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></a><p>ALARIC “hates everything” about being a vampire. He’s having trouble dealing with the blood lust. And he’s lost his “game.” Elena’s new medical professor person tried hitting on him and Alaric totally stumbled.</p><p>Ah, yes, ELENA. She’s been taking some witchy drug cooked up for her by Luke all summer because it makes her hallucinate Damon. But it also makes her really thirsty and it’s led to her attacking some humans. She realizes she has to let go.</p><p>But she can’t. So she asks Alaric to compel her to forget Damon forever toward the end of the premiere. Think she’ll go through wit it?</p><p>Overall, a very solid opening to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Vampire Diaries Season 6</a>. We caught up with every single character and we saw the effect the loss of their friends has had on them. But where are those friends?!?</p><p>Go <a href=# rel=noopener>watch The Vampire Diaries online</a> via TV Fanatic and sound off here with your take on “I’ll Remember.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2Z9cMDHnmSvmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBuv8SaqqimXWt6przIrKadnV1merOxwpqnaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscars-nomadaland-frances-mcdormand-adopted.html><span>←</span><span>How Oscars star Frances McDormand was abandoned by 'white trash' parents and saved by religious coup</span></a>
