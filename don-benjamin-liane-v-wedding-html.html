The couple could&nbsp;be seen enjoying, for lack of a better word, a private dance.&nbsp;</p><p>The new bride, clad in a beautiful white dress with a see-through skirt, gave the groom a sultry lapdance as the attendees cheered them on.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The groom, who sported a dapper green tuxedo, laid back on a chair in the middle of the crowd and let his wife do her thing, but apparently, he couldn't let her have all the fun.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After sharing a quick kiss, the groom got up from his chair, put his arms around his loving bride, and swiftly let her take the seat. It was his turn to groove to the beat.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Groom's Turn to Groove</h2><p>Moonwalking across the floor, Benjamin caused the crowd to cheer on, even louder than they initially were.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He took the floor to himself, shuffling about and teasing his wife as he did.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The guests couldn't help but shower the floor in dollar bills and capture as much of the moment as they could on their handheld devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking in the hype from the surrounding crowd, the new hubby invited V to join him on the floor. How could she decline? The clip ended with the newly married couple dancing in one another's embrace.&nbsp;</p><p>The dance video came online hours after the couple's joint Instagram account shared snaps of their rehearsal wedding and announced that the wedding was due that very day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>They Share an Eventful History</h2><p>The couple began dating&nbsp;after being friends for the better part of three years.</p><p>Together, the two of them cater content to their fans via a joint YouTube channel, Forever Us, where they post&nbsp;cool challenges, travel videos, cooking videos, and bits of advice on relationships.</p><p>Taking things a step further, the Chicago native asked his stunning girlfriend to be his wife on her birthday.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On August 22, 2019, <a href=# rel=follow>Benjamin got down on one knee</a>, a square halo diamond ring in hand, and popped the question. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And, while their wedding is a milestone that tells fans that everything turned out okay, things weren't always as smooth.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In January 2020, the couple announced through a video on their channel that they were parting ways to work on "things."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Although they did not outright disclose the reason for their split and assured fans that they would be amicable exes, a later video from V implied that Benjamin had cheated on her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In the video uploaded to her Instagram, she outed that he broke her trust. Thankfully, the couple found it in them to put the rough patch behind them, and they got back together in early 2021.</p><p>Making their relationship Instagram official yet again, the duo came to fans with a video titled 'Are We Getting Back Together?'&nbsp;</p><p>Spoiler! the answer was yes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyfo3qjsc2jmKahnmK5qq3NnmSvZaeasaW1zaBloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-brook.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Brook Biography</span></a>
