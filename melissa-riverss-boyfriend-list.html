People born in the Year of the Monkey pursue interests. If it's something they don't particularly enjoy, they'll sloppily complete the task. If it's something they're passionate about, they'll labor tirelessly until they achieve it. They have a long life full of vitality and wonder about the world. Relationships are important to monkeys as well. However, pampering children may be one of their flaws.</p><p>People born on January 20 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Aquarius</strong>. Despite the "aqua" in its name, Aquarius is the zodiac's final air sign. Aquarius is represented by the water carrier, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, onto the earth. Aquarius is innovative, progressive, and brazenly revolutionary. Aquarius is thus the most humanistic astrological sign. Aquarius, at the end of the day, is committed to making the world a better place.</p><p>Daughter of the legendary comedienne Joan Rivers. She also starred on Celebrity Apprentice.
