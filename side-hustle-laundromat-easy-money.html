Investing in math, not feelings.”</p><p>So how did Codie launch such a successful business through her own willpower?</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about side hustles">Read more about side hustles</h2><p>Codie said she “practically sold (her) soul” working “a million hours” to earn her first $100,000, but there was an easier way.</p><p>She said the most realistic way she made $100,000 was actually from buying a local laundromat.</p><h2>The process of getting there</h2><p>By finding a laundromat owner who was looking to retire, Codie was able to get seller financing on the deal.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>This means that the buyer can pay the seller in installments rather than using a traditional mortgage from a bank or credit union.</p><p>This lowers the upfront costs and allows you to pay for a property using some of the profits you are earning from running the business already.</p><p>“I didn’t realize that that was something normal,” Codie said.</p><p>“I just asked them if there was any way I could pay it over a time period.”</p><p>Codie’s effort paid off.</p><p>She said this one little change in deciding to own a business with cash flow as opposed to having an income tied to a role and always having to ask a company for more money changed everything for her.</p><p>The laundromat ended up doing a lot more in revenue, so Codie was able to pay back the seller and make more than $37,000 a year.</p><p>That amount was all based on a business that is fairly automated.</p><p>“The things you do for your first $100,000 are not going to be the things you do for your last $100,000,” Codie told followers.</p><h2>What you need to know running a laundromat</h2><p>Owning a laundromat does not require you to be at the store all the time, but it does entail monitoring the shop occasionally, collecting the earnings and making sure your equipment is clean and working.</p><p>You will have to decide on your business model, and there are many ways to make payment automatic for customers.</p><p>If you have other help, you’ll need to add a payroll in addition to figuring out your marketing plan as a business.</p><p>Remember that any <a href=#>side hustle</a> requires you to report all income on your taxes like you would any other job.</p><h2>Other side hustles</h2><p>While Codie has proven a successful track record with her laundromat business, there are various other hustles you can take up without the upfront costs.</p><p>For instance, one TikToker revealed the best <a href=#>remote working jobs</a> to do at nighttime.</p><p>These include being a virtual assistant or even a customer care professional, but the schedules are on your own terms.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>There’s also an <a href=#>unbelievable side hustle</a> netting profits of $30,000 for just 10 minutes of work a day.</p><p>Plus, if you have the chops to talk to people often on the phone, you could land $120,000 per year with <a href=#>just your phone.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa4F3fZJwbmirmZmybrTUrKulnV2hrra6w6umppmkYrKiv9hmpKimla58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-jones-19950607-html.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Jones (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
