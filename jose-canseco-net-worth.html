He reportedly made over $40 million from his 17-year MLB career, which he spent as soon as he got it. In 1990, he signed a five-year $23.5 million contract with the Oakland Athletics — however, his peak salary was the $5.8 million he earned from the Boston Red Sox in 1995.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Jose Canseco</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Former MLB player</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $800,000</p><p>Jose Canseco is a former MLB outfielder and designated hitter. He's a two-time World Series champion, six-time All-Star, and became the first player in MLB history to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in one season. After retiring in 2002, he competed in boxing and mixed martial arts.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> July 2, 1964</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Havana, Cuba</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> José Canseco Capas Jr.</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Jose Canseco Sr.</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Barbara Canseco</p><p><strong>Siblings:</strong> Ozzie Canseco</p><p><strong>Marriages:</strong> Esther Haddad (1988-1992) and Jessica Canseco (1996-1999)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Josephine "Josie" Canseco (b.

Clearly, he's made some money back, but it's unlikely Jose will ever achieve millionaire status again with his spending habits.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Josie Canseco's net worth?</h2><p>Unlike her father, Josie is in the millionaire club! According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the model is worth $2 million. Josie's earned most, if not all, of her wealth through various modeling gigs — she's been featured in Love Magazine, Teen Vogue, and Playboy, among other publications. She's also modeled for Sherri Hill and made her Victoria's Secret debut in 2018.</p><p>As a teenager, Josie appeared with her mother on VH1's Hollywood Exes and starred in the second season of the internet web series SummerBreak 2, which could've contributed a bit to her finances as well.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the since-deleted Instagram posts, Josie noted she was in debt for "years," barely making $100 a week at the start of her career and living in tiny NY apartments with several other models.</p><p>Although she acknowledged that she's "been graced with a privilege of being born within a family that earned what they earned," she added, "I really went through that s--t [and] busted my a-- the traditional way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7y0sYycmKerlZi8brrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-rooney.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Rooney</span></a>
