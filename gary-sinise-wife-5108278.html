The same can be said for his marriage, as Gary and his wife, <strong>Moira Harris</strong>, said “I do” over four decades ago! “[The secret to longevity is] a sense of humor,” Gary once claimed of his marriage to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade </a>in 2011. “My wife’s a loving, funny, Irish-spirited person, and I’m still surprised at some of the things she says. She makes me laugh every day.” Meet the gorgeous woman who stole Gary’s heart all those years ago, below!</p><h2>How Did Moira Meet Gary?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Moira was born in Pontiac, Illinois in 1954. Like Gary, she caught the acting bug at an early age and studied drama in college at Illinois State University, where she met her future husband.</p><h2>She Is Also An Actress</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Moira has been featured in television series like The Equalizer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Karen Sisco. according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB</a>. She’s also appeared in a number of Gary’s films, including Miles from Home&nbsp;and&nbsp;Of Mice and Men. She retired from acting in 2003, although she briefly returned for an appearance in <strong>Harold Pinter’s</strong> <i>The Birthday Party</i> at Steppenwolf Theatre in 2013.</p><h2>Their First Wedding Was Called Off</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>In his 2019 memoir, Grateful American: A Journey From Self To Service, Gary revealed they had to cancel their first wedding ceremony. He claimed that the pair had planned everything, down to the invitations and wedding date, but a few days before the wedding, the couple broke their engagement over cold feet, only to reconcile a few days later.</p><h2>Moira & Gary Share 3 Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Born on November 9, 1988, <strong>Sophie Sinise </strong>is the eldest child of Gary and Moira. She is also an actress, making her acting debut in a 2010 episode of CSI: N.Y., which also boasts her father as a cast member. <strong>McCanna Anthony Sinise</strong>, born on November 10, 1990, is the only son of the married couple. Born in 2011, <strong>Ella</strong> rounds out the big brood as the youngest child.</p><h2>Moira Struggled With Substance Abuse Disorder</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Moira tried rehab for her alcohol abuse disorder twice before she was finally able to dive into sobriety, according to Gary’s memoir. “I’d get rid of all the booze in the house, but then I’d open a top cabinet and find a bottle tucked far away in the back,” he wrote. After a three-month rehab stint in 1997, Gary wrote that his wife had not touched “a drop of alcohol” since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8aaqbJlo567qr%2FEZq6inpVignJ8l2tucWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-who-root-for-the-philadelphia-eagles-bradley-cooper-sylvester-stallone-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrity Eagles Fans: Bradley Cooper, Sylvester Stallone and More</span></a>
