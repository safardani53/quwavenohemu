Bette didn’t give too much away in regards to a&nbsp; plot but said “Oh, yeah,” about taking on the sequel and that at this point, “We’re just talking logistics.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bette-midler-hocus-pocus-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>SJP has already said that it would ‘be a very very fun’ idea to take part in a sequel to the Halloween classic.

We’ll see what the future holds.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Hocus Pocus as become so iconic in pop culture that it was only a matter of time before a sequel came to fruition. Singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> in her 2019 debut year as a daytime talk show host blew all of her other chat fest competition out of the water by doing her Halloween show <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in costume as Bette’s Winifred</a>. She wore the infamous, giant red wig, green velvet robe, had the same puckered mouth with red lipstick, and even showed off that she has the same killer pipes as the 300-year-old witch. Kelly performed Bette’s classic “I Put A Spell On You” from the film for her audience, and pretty much won Halloween 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49rZpudpKmybrnInaOeql2dvKTB0manqJulqHq0sdCunKVlmaN6ta3LpKpmpJ%2BctrTAyJyqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-jenner-cheetah-clutches-kim-kardashian-khloe-mothers-day-presents.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Jenner Gifts Cheetah Clutches To Kim &amp;amp; Khloe Kardashian: Watch Hollywood Life</span></a>
