You may have heard of him. While high school-aged Turner is in the midst of living his best rebellious rich boy life, Bruce Wayne is murdered. And yes, Turner is a brand new character The CW seems to have invented out of the blue.</p><p>Without having any time to mourn, Turner is accused of being involved in the shocking slaying. Alongside the other suspects — the offspring of Batman's greatest enemies, including the Joker — Turner must rise as the new savior of Gotham. The eccentric quad becomes known as the Gotham Knights. It can go either way really. So, when's the release date for Gotham Knights?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When does 'Gotham Knights' premiere on The CW?</h2><p>Gotham Knights will likely premiere on The CW sometime in 2023, though no solidified date has been released yet.</p><p>"When a hero falls, a new generation will rise. #CWGothamKnights is coming in 2023 to The CW!" the official Instagram account for the series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> with the release of the trailer.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook.com</a>, Gotham Knights is one of three new series a part of The CW's 2022–2023 season, "including the Walker prequel, Walker: Independence, and the Supernatural prequel, The Winchesters."</p><p>The Flash and Superman & Lois are two other DC series included in the 2022–2023 season.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gotham Knights (@cwgothamknights)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@cwgothamknights</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">People are wondering why the character of Turner Hayes was created in the first place.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Bruce Wayne adopted Turner after his biological parents were murdered.
