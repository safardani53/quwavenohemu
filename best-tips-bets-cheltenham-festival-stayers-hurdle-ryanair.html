Yesterday Put the Kettle On was super tough in the Champion Chase and of course Honeysuckle so sweet in Tuesday’s Champion Hurdle.
The big one today is the fantastically sponsored Grade 1 Paddy Power Stayers' Hurdle over 3m.
With Thyme Hill out, this really is a great opportunity for PAISLEY PARK to regain his crown for Aidan Coleman – on board Put the Kettle on - and Emma Lavelle."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Many believe Envoi Allen just has to turn up here and they may well be right.</p><p>However, I'm going to have a few quid on <strong>CHANTRY HOUSE</strong> eachway. He's won five from seven in his career and was a fine third behind Shishkin in the Supreme Novices' Hurdle of 2020.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>CHELTENHAM FREE BETS: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET £60 IN FREE BETS WITH WILLIAM HILL</a></strong></p><p>Connections were a little disappointed that day, but he still ran a good enough race.</p><p>In three chase runs, Chantry House has won at Ascot and Wetherby with a bad run at Cheltenham in between. The drying ground will help and he must have place claims for Nico de Boinville and Nicky Henderson.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Next it’s the Pertemps Network Final over 3m. <strong>SOUTHFIELD HARVEST</strong> has only run a couple of times over three miles and they are his best efforts in a light career.</p><p>His third at Newbury last time was a fine performance and cheekpieces have now been applied which might help him in the closing stages when push comes to shove. An eachway selection for Paul Nicholls and Harry Cobden.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the Stayers’ it’s the Grade 1 Ryanair Chase over an extended 2m4f.</p><p>Forgive <strong>MIN </strong>his last run and he'd be a lot shorter in the betting. The defending champion is easily the form choice on his success last year when he had Saint Calvados, A Plus Tard and Frodon beaten off.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">DOWNLOAD THE NEW SUN RACING APP NOW</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IOS_ANDROID-Option-2-1.jpg><p><strong>The ultimate home for all your racing needs.</strong></p><p><strong>Number one for tips, betting offers and news - as well as full racecards and an interactive results and odds comparison service.</strong></p><p><strong>Download from the App store - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Download on Android - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a></strong></p><p>He returned this term in fine style at Punchestown (albeit in the fog!), but then jumped terribly and was pulled up when last seen.</p><p>I'm told he's back bouncing at home and even though he's ten there is nothing to suggest he's beyond his best. Min loves Cheltenham and should run huge for Willie Mullins and Paul Townend.</p><p>After the Stayers’ it’s the Grade 3 Paddy Power Plate Handicap Chase over an extended 2m4f.</p><p>This is wide open. <strong>MISTER WHITAKER</strong> is 2lb lower in the handicap than when third behind Simply the Betts last season.</p><p>He's not been in as good form this term, but his first effort was over 3m and he wasn't so bad last time at Warwick. I'll be having a few quid&nbsp;on eachway for Jonathan Burke and Mick Channon.&nbsp;</p><p>A slight drop in class next with a Grade 2 mares' novices' hurdle over 2m1f. A very hard race to sort out.</p><p><strong>ROSEYS HOLLOW</strong> was super tough when going clear to land a Grade 3 at Fairyhouse last time and if she copes with these better conditions should could run a huge one for Jonathan Sweeney and Mark Walsh.</p><p>The JP McManus runner looks to be improving all the time and should have eachway claims at the very least.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>CHELTENHAM SPECIAL OFFER: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET £110 IN FREE BETS</a></strong></p><p>And finally the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup Handicap Chase over 3m2f.</p><p>At the age of eleven you would think <strong>SHANTOU FLYER</strong> was a bit old for this but he has a great Cheltenham record and he could at the least hit the frame for Paul Nicholls and Harry Cobden.</p><p>My hope has been in consistent form for a long time, and was third behind It Came To Pass in the Foxhunter this time last year.
