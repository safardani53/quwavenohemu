I'm a star. I'm a star I'm a star. I'm a big bright shining star. That's right."</p><p>Another contestant, Jen, got it correct as "What is: Boogie Nights."</p><p>To which Ken then snuck in: “Sorry we couldn't show the clip.”</p><p>The clue was, of course, referencing the final shot of 1997's Boogie Nights.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p><a href=#>Marky Mark</a> played adult film actor Dirk Diggler - and went nude for the memorable movie moment with a certain oversized prosthetic add-on.</p><p>In the closing scene, he amped himself up in front of a mirror just before he went off to perform in a pornographic film and flaunted his 'prop.'</p><h2>'I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING'</h2><p>The contestants and even the audience needed a second to get it and before all nervously laughing - Jen was still chuckling while selecting the next clue.</p><p>Fans went wild in an internet Reddit thread as one user wrote: “Ken's 'Sorry we couldn't show the clip' quip about the ending of Boogie Nights is the funniest, dirtiest joke that I can recall ever seeing on the show.</p><p>I almost missed the next clue because I was laughing out loud.”</p><p>"Reminds me of the contestant who prayed for snow on her wedding day, didn't get any but "got 8 inches on my honeymoon,'" wrote another.</p><p>"A+ joke from @KenJennings after that Boogie Nights response" applauded a third on Twitter.</p><h2>IMPRESSIVE 2-DAY WINNER</h2><p>From there, Sharon waved around her knowledge by nabbing enough clues to have a runaway - or ensured win - by Final Jeopardy! for her second game in a row.</p><p>Sharon had $15,500, Brittany had $6,800, and Jen had $6,400.</p><p>Final Jeopardy! under "City History" read: "Over 700 years after its traditional 1252 founding date, this port city became associated with a psychological response."</p><p>Only Sharon was correct with "Stockholm" - the clue referring to Stockholm Syndrome, and she added a safe $1,100 to win $16,600 and a with a combined $33K.</p><p>Other Reddit users then expressed excitement to see how far Sharon - who revealed her sister was also once on the game show but came in third - will go.</p><p>One fan wrote: "I rooting for Sharon to be a five-day champ! So far there are no females on the leaderboard for this season."</p><p>Another agreed: "Sharon has dangerously good recall. By which I mean: it feels as if she'll get almost any question she knows the answer to if she has at least a couple of seconds to ruminate. And she knows the answer to a lot of questions."</p><p>A third person similarly expressed: "Sharon is quietly dominating with her 2 lock games and 4/4 on Daily Doubles. I’m hoping we see her in the next Tournament of Champions!"</p><p>A fourth person snarked: "Wow, this game show is desperate for a woman champion to be in this year's Tournament of Champions. That being said, yay for Sharon!"</p><p>A fifth wrote: "Two days this week with all-female contestants. Can the producers be bending over backward to get a woman Tournament of Champions-qualified? As sharp as Sharon has played so far (two lock games), they may finally get one."</p><p>There have been no female contestants to qualify for&nbsp;<a href=#>September's 2023 Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;this entire season, it takes four wins to do so and five to lock in a position.</p><p>So now all eyes are on Sharon, who also has done impressively well on rebound clues - or picking up other contestants' incorrect responses.</p><p>Seventy-four-time winner Ken and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 47, were announced as the successors for the late&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;over the summer.</p><p>Ken is hosting until April 28th at which point Mayim will return on May 1 and helm the last four months of the season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Fans will still get more of Ken - whom many have made clear they prefer between the two - as he is hosting&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!
