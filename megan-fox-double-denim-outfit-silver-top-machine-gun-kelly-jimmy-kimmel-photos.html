She styled her jeans with a strapless silver peplum top with a low-cut neckline and threw on a baggy denim jacket on top. She topped <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her look off</a> with a pair of metallic silver platform heels and gorgeous glam.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As for MGK, he rocked a baggy tan jumpsuit with pockets on the front of his chest and a black leather belt around his waist with silver grommets. The bottom half of his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baggy pants</a> were cut off just below his knees and he styled the one-piece with a black choker necklace and tan lace-up Rick Owens x Dr Martens Men Quad Sole Calf Length Boots.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In his interview on the show, MGK shared a funny story <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>about Megan</a>, and how he started to learn how to cook for her because she has many dietary restrictions that make it hard to eat at restaurants. “She really wanted gluten-free, coconut-free cinnamon buns so I got the recipe down, I went to the store, I got all of the ingredients and I’m making this huge commitment of cinnamon rolls,” he said. However, he soon realized that he didn’t have baking sheets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He then admitted that he recently found out his neighbor was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong></a> so he called him to borrow baking sheets he wasn’t home but he told him to go to his house and grab them. He then made them and presented them to her and she said they were good but he thought they were bad. So, Megan went out on an errand with the kids and when she came back they were so excited to eat them but he admitted he was “so ashamed of his cinnamon rolls” that he threw them all away. When the kids and Megan found this out, they were so upset and he joked that it’s still a sore subject between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49xZqadl5a7brLOsWSdp6WXuaZ5w56loqVdpMK1ssitZKyhnKuys3nTqKdmpZGYtaq6xGaerqZdoLKtuNhmoaKlna56rLXMppylZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-garoppolo.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Garoppolo Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</span></a>
