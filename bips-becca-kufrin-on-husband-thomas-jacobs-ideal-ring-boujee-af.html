Love you forever, my little pumpkin 🎃💍,” the couple wrote at the time via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in a joint post. “Now let’s get married!”</p><p>Kufrin, who held the <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> season 14 title, headed down to the beaches of Bachelor in Paradise in 2021 where she met Jacobs. Despite coupling up during season 7 of the reality show, Kufrin broke things off with Jacobs ahead of the season finale. But by August 2021, <a href=#>the pair reconciled</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We came back [home] and had to explore that on our own away from the cameras but in that moment [on the beach during the finale], I think that was game-changing for me,” Kufrin explained during an episode of the “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation” podcast at the time. “Because I have really never had somebody fight, I would say, like, tooth and nail to want to keep a relationship with me.”</p><p>She continued: “We chatted until, like, 3 or 4 in the morning some nights and just talked about any and everything. The second I saw him — because I flew back to L.A. and then drove down to San Diego — I think right away he picked me up and kissed me and then we just had unlimited time to explore what this could be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboaCoeqOxwpyYZqOlm7%2BquoyopWagpaivorrDZquhp52WwG62wJymm6tdnrGmrctmqaKml2KvsMHJnpxmmZZk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./9-holiday-cocktails-to-try-in-new-york-city.html><span>←</span><span>9 Holiday Cocktails to Try in New York City</span></a>
