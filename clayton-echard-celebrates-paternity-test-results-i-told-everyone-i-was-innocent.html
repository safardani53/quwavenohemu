As previously reported, the former Bachelor lead was sued this summer by a woman who claimed she slept with the reality star several months ago… and was now pregnant with his baby as a result.
Echard strongly denied this claim, however.
He said the two only engaged in oral sex and there’s simply no change the impending child belongs to him."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
