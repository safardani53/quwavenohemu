The boy is smitten.</p><p>“She’s amazing,” says <a href=#>Olly</a>, opening up about the relationship for the first time.</p><p>“She’s just a great person, full of love, she’s caring, sensitive, doesn’t suffocate me, lets me be me, loves the fact I’m cheeky and flirty and isn’t trying to change that. I love being around her. She’s one of my best mates and then she is my lover and girlfriend.”</p><p>It’s taken Olly, 35, a while to get to this stage. He’s been single since 2015 after being left heartbroken over the split from his previous girlfriend of three years, <a href=#>Francesca Thomas</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Olly-2-e1578106022997.jpg><p>“I feel like I needed that time away. I struggled after the break-up with my ex. I had moments of dealing with the fact I wasn’t with her any more, then I’d come back to reality alone again and would fill the gaps with dating girls and partying and papering over the cracks.</p><p>“I had to go away and learn to enjoy who I am and that’s when I realised, actually, that wasn’t the right relationship, it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t great and I need to move on.</p><p>“Getting to that point took ages, but around the start of this year something just clicked. I was waiting for that person to come along, and it was Amelia.”</p><p><a href=#>Olly and Amelia</a> – dubbed Tank The Bank because of her high-flying financial career – shared a few dates at the start of the year, but his schedule filming <a href=#>The Voice</a>, promoting his album You Know I Know and then preparing for his sell-out arena tour this summer meant at first it was difficult to commit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amelia-e1578106078516.jpg><p>“I wasn’t quite ready to give her everything I could and that wasn’t fair. So after a few weeks of us dating, I just said: ‘Look, I have things to do.’</p><p>“But then during the tour we rekindled things and it was me who pushed that. I told her I wanted to see what happened and it just felt right. When it feels right you go with it, don’t you?</p><p>“It’s going in the right direction and it feels great. I’ve been single for many years and I can say this is the happiest I’ve been in a very long time. You realise when you meet someone great that this is what it’s supposed to feel like.”</p><p>Olly says it’s been “refreshing” no longer having to navigate the politics of dating, which in his case often involved having to factor in dodging the paparazzi as well.<br></p><h2>'SO THANKFUL AND HAPPY'</h2><p>“When you’re just dating people and it’s like: ‘I’m sort of seeing her, but I’m also seeing how it goes…’ You just want to go on a date, have a drink, get to know this person without the f**king paps being outside when you leave.</p><p>"The date might be s**t, but the last thing I want to do is get papped with her and have some other girl who I am actually interested in see it! So it is a bit of a mind f**k.</p><p>“It’s so refreshing to go out in a public place and not give a f**k who sees me. I’m so thankful and happy I have met Amelia.”</p><p>The last six months have been a game-changer for Olly – and <a href=#>not just because of Amelia</a>. The knee operation in June that saw him undergo an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, a meniscus transplant and a realignment of his tibia (phew!) to correct a 12-year-old injury, meant an extended absence from work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Shot01_096-copy-e1578106166799.jpg><p>And he decided, after 10 years in the public eye, to take the opportunity to switch off completely. That’s meant going back to basics and quitting social media, temporarily at least.</p><p>“I needed to make some changes to my life and it’s been good to shut everything down for everything really, for my love life, my career… everything. I needed to come away and my family have said how nice it’s been to see me so relaxed.</p><p>“Over the past 10 years I’ve been constantly moving, thinking of ideas, always on my phone, on Instagram. And I didn’t have any proper time for anyone. So this really brought me back to reality and I needed that, massively. I needed to get off social media, and you know what? I haven’t missed it at all.</p><p>“My world isn’t based on likes or fake people. Going on tour and seeing my fans is much more powerful than seeing how many likes I’ve got on a photo. I want people screaming my name and singing my songs, not writing stuff on social media.”</p><p>It’s well documented that a lot of people are struggling with mental health and I honestly believe social media is not helping with that</p><span class=quote-credit>Olly Murs</span><p>He plans to return to Instagram this month – he has work to promote, of course – but will use it far less than he did.</p><p>Olly has spoken in the past about his struggles with anxiety, and the effect his social media sabbatical has had on his mental health has been revelatory.</p><p>“I think a part of me probably used it because I was single and looking around. Like most single people on Instagram, it was about finding people to chat to. You’d comment on a picture and they’d comment on yours and a few days later you’re having dinner.</p><p>“I think it’s important to promote breaks for people on social media. It’s well documented that a lot of people are struggling with mental health and I honestly believe social media is not helping with that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Shot03_519-copy-e1578106253497.jpg><p>“Now I’m like: ‘Wow, I got so sucked into this stupid world of nonsense’. Twitter used to be a fun place. Now it’s full of negative, opinionated people. It doesn’t mean I will stop forever – I have The Voice and I want people to see it. But I will definitely use it less.”</p><p>He has used the time off wisely, reconnecting with family and friends, spending time with Amelia and even learning to play the piano.</p><p>“My surgeon was worried that this time off might make me depressed. Look at <a href=#>Andy Murray</a> – having major surgery can get you into a dark place. But I was so positive. I decided to learn the piano, so I have a teacher who comes every week and I’m hoping to do my Grade 1 at the end of January.</p><p>“I’m training three or four times a week to get my weight down and to get my leg strong again. I have physio and, obviously, I have a girlfriend now.</p><h2>'NEW HAIR, NEW ME'</h2><p>“I’ve been going out with friends and enjoying going around to my nan’s every Wednesday. Even just living in my house has been amazing. I have a beautiful home in Essex that I’m proud of, and it’s been so nice being there.”</p><p>There’s also been a dramatic change of image. The trademark Murs quiff (RIP) is no more.</p><p>“I’d threatened to shave my head a few times and my team always laughed at me and said: ‘The quiff is forever’, but I was just bored. It feels quite liberating, like a new me moving forward.</p><p>“Sometimes, I look in the mirror and think: ‘What have I done?’ It’ll probably take some fans and a few people a while to get used to it, but why not? New hair, new knee, new me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000483876724-e1578106326763.jpg><p>It’s been 10 years since Olly finished as runner-up on The X Factor (<a href=#>Joe McElderry</a> won the series), and in that time he’s gone on to become one of the show’s most successful exports. Four No.1 albums, 13 Top 20 singles and five arena tours – and yet he’s consistently overlooked when it comes to industry awards.</p><p>He was nominated for Best British Male at the BRITs in 2013, but lost out on the night despite having had a quadruple-platinum-selling Right Place Right Time album, and his biggest single to date, Troublemaker. That must rankle, surely?</p><p>“I know I should have won in 2013,” he says, candidly. “I was getting No.1s left, right and centre and selling out tours, I should have at least won something, but it’s not something I begrudge, because the person who won that year, [Ben Howard, FYI], it was massive for them.</p><p>“I do think there was a period in that time where I was ‘the guy from X Factor’, and that probably did hinder me a bit because although I was successful, I wasn’t the cool kid.”</p><p>I’ve performed and been nominated at the BRITs, and there aren’t many artists who can say that. And I still believe that one day I will win one</p><span class=quote-credit>Olly Murs</span><p>Olly remembers being backstage that evening and bumping into <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> who was presenting the award later on.</p><p>“I saw Ed before the show and I said how happy I was that he was going to give me the award and he kind of bowed his head and said: ‘I’m really sorry mate, but you’re not winning.’ And I was a bit shocked.</p><p>“He said: ‘I can’t have you say that to me and me walk away knowing I know that information. I’m so sorry’.</p><p>“And I was like: ‘I f**king love this man. Fair enough, he’s told me’.” At least having that information made it easier when it came to prepping the all-important magnanimous-in-defeat smile, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/COLLECT-OLLY-MURS-COPYRIGHT.-IMG_2498-e1578106405993.jpg><p>“Well, no,” says Olly. “Because a part of me still thought Ed could be bluffing! I had this vision of walking on stage and him going: ‘Ahh – got ya!’ But he was telling the truth. And I had so much respect for him for that.</p><p>“I remember all the names got called out and mine had the biggest cheer and Dave Grohl, who was sitting at our table, was like: ‘That guy Olly Murs is going to win this one’. Just from the reaction of the crowd.</p><p>“And then Ed went: ‘And the winner is…”</p><p>He pauses and needs to be reminded of Ben Howard’s name.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The last...</h3></p><p><strong>Book you read?</strong> Manchester United: The Ferguson Years (Backpass Through History).</p><p><strong>Movie you saw?</strong> Upgrade.</p><p><strong>Box set you watched?</strong> The Morning Show – it is f**king amazing. The cast is incredible.</p><p><strong>Time you cried?</strong> Filming The Voice.</p><p><strong>Time you were drunk?</strong> A week ago with my tour manager. We got very drunk over an Indian.</p><p><strong>WhatsApp you received?</strong> I just sent my photos from the Fabulous shoot to my missus. She ain’t f**king replied!</p><p><strong>Time you had sex?</strong> This morning.</p><p>Olly continues: “Look, Ben is a great artist. They’re all great artists and have worked as hard as I did. I could have easily gone on social media saying I should have won, but I’d just look like a sore loser.</p><p>“Everything I enter I want to win. If you and me played rock, paper, scissors now, I’d want to win. We all want recognition as artists, but awards don’t pay my bills or for the holidays or the life I want to live. I’ve performed and been nominated at the BRITs, and there aren’t many artists who can say that. And I still believe that one day I will win one.”</p><p>Besides, he kind of does have one, in a roundabout way, thanks to <a href=#>Harry Styles</a>.</p><p>Last year Olly was presenting the award for Best Video, which was won by Harry who wasn’t at the ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Getty-WI_The_Voice_UK_2019___Photocall_kt2_3250_2019121631542712jpg-JS548170784-e1578106472762.jpg><p>“I said on stage: ‘I’ve never won a BRIT so I am taking this one home’ – and obviously I didn’t do that! But about a month later I received a parcel from Harry and he’d written a note saying: ‘You can have one of mine’. It was like his way of saying: ‘Murs, you never got one and you should have’, so he gave me his.</p><p>"He’d had the engraving changed so it reads: ‘Sign of the Times, Harry Styles for Olly Murs’. That says a lot about Harry. He’s a gent.”</p><p>Olly is unsure if there will be any potential award-winning new music this year, preferring to focus on the <a href=#>latest series of The Voice</a>, which started on ITV last night.</p><p>Outgoing fellow coach and good friend <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson</a> has been replaced by <a href=#>Meghan Trainor</a> and Olly, now in his third season, is defending his title having won last year with his contestant Molly Hocking.</p><h2>'THE X FACTOR NEEDS A BREAK'</h2><p>“It’s nice to not be the newbie any more!” he laughs. His first encounter with Meghan was unusual, to say the least.</p><p>“Her song Dear Future Husband sounds like Dance With Me Tonight,” he says. Which it does. Very much.</p><p>“And I saw her and said: ‘I have a bone to pick with you!’ And she was like: ‘I know, Olly!’</p><p>“She said she remembered being in the studio and saying she wanted to make a song like Dance With Me Tonight, something with that vibe. But she didn’t realise the producer actually copied it. She said she was like: ‘No, I don’t want the same track!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000477291132-e1578106552417.jpg><p>“Ha ha! You know, it was a lovely compliment that she heard my song and liked it. I wish I’d won a Grammy for mine!”</p><p>Olly knows exactly how these contestants feel when they step out. He came from <a href=#>The X Factor</a> in its heyday although the most recent celebrity version of the show saw ratings slump below 3 million.</p><p>“I watched it,” he says. “It was… interesting.” That sounds like diplomacy. Olly takes a deep breath. He has a huge sense of loyalty to the show that made his name but, to his credit, he’s also never anything less than honest.</p><p>“I love The X Factor. I don’t want this to sound bad, but <a href=#>I think the show needs a break</a>. It doesn’t mean it is over and can’t come back. But it needs a break.</p><p>It made me, so when I say that, I say so with a sad heart, because I don’t want it to not be on TV</p><span class=quote-credit>Olly Murs</span><p>“And it breaks my heart that it’s nowhere near as big as it used to be. It made me, so when I say that, I say so with a sad heart, because I don’t want it to not be on TV. I want it to help change people’s lives.</p><p>“It’s like an ex-girlfriend, you don’t want to say goodbye, but all good things come to an end and unfortunately that happens.”</p><p>When it comes to his own future, Olly is very open to ideas. He’s not planning too far ahead and is happy to see where this year takes him.</p><p>“I think I’m someone who is a bit of a Jack of all trades. You’ve seen me present TV shows, coach on them, sing, dance. I’m always looking for something that excites me and gives me a tingle.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>“So 2020 is an open book. I want to do a few things I’ve never done before and see what happens, whether that’s acting or TV or my own show, radio or new music. There is no plan, I’m on a road and I don’t know where I’m going but I’m excited.”</p><p>And mindful of what the last six months have taught him, he adds: “More than anything, I just want to live in the present.</p><p>“The past has been written, the future is undecided. Whatever happens, this is going to be very much an in the moment year for me.”</p><ul><li><strong>Watch The Voice UK, Saturdays, 8.30pm, ITV</strong></li></ul><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Olly Murs reveals he met his girlfriend when he took a break from showbiz during a knee surgery recovery on GMB</span><ul><li><strong>Credits: Hair & grooming: Mellissa Brown for Cloud Twelve Salon using Charlotte Tilbury and Paul Mitchell.
