"This is not true, any of it. June won’t let me see or talk to Alana."</p><p>"The last time I saw Alana was at mine and Jennifer’s wedding … I’ve tried to stay in touch with my daughter but June won’t let me."</p><p>Moreover, "I never told Alana to lose weight or said anything to Alana about her weight. June’s a damn liar. I would never hurt Alana."</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Family</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>There’s no love lost on either end of this feud, clearly.</p><p>Asked recently if she has any feelings at all for her ex-partner, June basically said that Sugar Bear sucks and deserves what he gets:</p><p>"No. I’ve never hated anybody as much as I hate him."</p><p>"I have to call him out on his bullsh-t," she added, defending her recent media blitz.
