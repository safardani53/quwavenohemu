Because all of them, every single one of them is completely dependent on the other financially. None of them can support their families outside the family business,” Joy continued.</p><p>“They have not spoken up because they will be cut off, lose their cushy lives, and have to work for a living.”</p><p>Joy went on to allege that the Duggar men are constitutionally incapable of working for a living or taking care of themselves, and they might therefore feel that they have no choice but to continue supporting Josh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The Duggar sons have very limited drive or work ethic,” she wrote.</p><p>“The sons do the bare minimum to survive. They are lazy and care more to play than work. They grew up entitled and every girl wanted to date them,” Joy continued.</p><p>“They have no manners and let me say this — Josh might be a pedophile, but the stories about his brothers aren’t much better.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Obviously, that’s a very serious allegation, but Joy swears she can back it up.</p><p>In the comments, fans demanded additional information, but she says the time for going public with her epic Duggar dirt has not yet arrived.</p><p>“Until a victim comes forward, I will not tell someone else’s story,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“But the crap in this family isn’t limited to Josh. They protect him for a reason.”</p><p>It’s true that none of the men in the Duggar family have come forward to condemn Josh, but we wonder if that will change soon.</p><p>After all, <a href=#>Jed Duggar almost spoke out against Josh</a> in his most recent YouTube video, but he stopped just short of saying that he believes his brother is guilty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Perhaps the other Duggar men will feel more comfortable speaking their truth <a href=#>once Josh’s appeal fails</a>.</p><p>Of course, if Jim Bob continues to threaten them with financial independence, then it’s unlikely that any of the Duggars will breathe a word against their disgraced brother.</p><p>After all, as Joy said, these guys really, really don’t like to work.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2BcLDUoJ6aql2Xv7DAx56prGWYmr%2Bmv4ytn55lopqurXnRnpisp55ixKnFjLCcZq2jmrFuwM5mm56elaOxbrbOrJ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-utd-alejandro-garnacho-cristiano-ronaldo.html><span>←</span><span>Fans all saying the same thing as Man Utd's Alejandro Garnacho spotted with Cristiano Ronaldo tribut</span></a>
