The comedian — fresh off <a href=#>his <i>SNL </i>return on the season 49 premiere</a> — looked casual in a tan-and-gray tracksuit with a coordinating baseball cap. Cline, for her part, opted for a black turtleneck and a matching pair of sweatpants. She completed her look with delicate gold jewelry and a black Kate Spade handbag.</p><p class=p2>Davidson and Cline were joined by <a href=#><strong>Sofia Hublitz</strong></a>, who twinned with the <i>Glass Onion </i>actress in all-black.</p><p class=p2><i>Us Weekly </i><a href=#>broke the news in September</a> that Davidson had started seeing Cline <a href=#>one month after his split</a> from <a href=#><strong>Chase Sui Wonders</strong>.</a><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>“Pete and Madelyn are dating,” a source told<i> Us</i>. “They spent the night together at the Beverly Hills Hotel and then had breakfast together there the next morning. They were really low-key and <a href=#>kept things casual</a>, wearing baseball hats.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pete-davidson-and-madelyn-cline-spotted-together-for-the-1st-time-01.jpg><p class=p2>Weeks later, an eyewitness told <i>Us </i>that Cline<a href=#> attended Davidson’s “Pete Davidson Live” stand-up show</a> at The Chelsea in Las Vegas on September 23. “[She] was laughing a ton, she had a huge smile on her face the whole time,” the insider noted.</p><p class=p2>A third source later told <i>Us </i>that Davidson and Cline have only been together for “several weeks,” but they are already close.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>“[Madelyn and Pete] had hoped to remain low-key for a while, especially because Madelyn is a really private person,” the source added. “But they’ve spent a lot of time together and<a href=#> have built a strong bond</a> in a short period of time.”</p><p class=p2>According to the insider, Davidson was enthralled by Cline’s “adorable” dry sense of humor — and that his sister, <a href=#><strong>Casey Davidson</strong></a>, gave them her seal of approval. “[Casey] is thrilled to see him so happy,” the source concluded.</p><p class=p2>Before sparking a romance with Pete, Cline last dated <a href=#><strong>Jackson Guthy</strong></a> before they split in July, which she confirmed <a href=#>by scrubbing his presence</a> from her social media page.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2>While Davidson’s<a href=#> dating history has frequently made headlines</a> — he even <a href=#>spoofed the attention on Saturday</a> in a version of <a href=#>“I’m Just Ken” from <i>Barbie</i></a> — Cline prefers to keep her love life to herself.</p><p class=p2>“I am a really private person. There’s a part of me that is for me and nobody else. But in hindsight, duh, making my relationship public made it everybody else’s business,” Cline — who previously dated her <i>Outer Banks </i>costar <a href=#><strong>Chase Stokes</strong> </a>from 2020 to 2021 — told&nbsp;<i>Cosmopolitan</i>&nbsp;in February. “And I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn’t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy. People see the need for sides. There are no sides — there’s no winning or losing in a breakup.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYq6vsIymmJ2dnK67bq%2FLoqWeZaOlvLXAxJ1kraeXmsGpsdFmnaiqXam1pnmQrKtmrJmisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-dons-camouflage-during-visit-to-military-base.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Dons Camouflage During Visit to Military Base</span></a>
