Every other new car is a Suzuki.</p><p>And if you need to change a lightbulb, brake pads or whatever, you are never more than 20 miles from a Suzuki service centre.</p><p>It’s a very different story here in Great Britainland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602668074.jpg><p>Last year we bought 35,000 Suzuki cars ­— that’s Ignis, Swift, Vitara, S-Cross and Jimny combined.</p><p>The Ford Fiesta sells double that on its own.</p><p>It makes you wonder why Suzuki even bothers to answer the phone to UK dealers.</p><p>But I’m glad it does. Because no one does small 4x4s quite like Suzuki.</p><p>Take the new-look Ignis I’ve been testing this week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602667999.jpg><p>It’s light and dinky — 895kg and just 3.7 metres long — yet it’s got the minerals to go that little bit farther for your Covid picnic.</p><p>It’s also a mild hybrid that returns a real-world 50mpg, as well as being distinctive and easy to live with — and cracking value.</p><p>Prices start at £13,999 for the Ignis SZ3 with front-wheel drive and a five-speed manual.</p><p>Finance from £139 a month with zero per cent finance and £1,970 up front.</p><p>The best-selling SZ-T at £15,499 adds nuggets like reversing camera and two individual rear seats that slide forwards and backwards by 16cm if you need more boot space or leg room. I like that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602668041.jpg><p>Then there’s the fully loaded SZ-5 at £17,499 — or £179 a month — which is the only version you can have with Suzuki’s simple but clever Allgrip all-wheel drive system.</p><p>That’s your insurance policy in slippery winter conditions, so go for that if you can afford it.</p><p>The SZ-5 also scored four stars out of five in EuroNCAP safety tests thanks to driver-assistance kit like dual-camera brake support.</p><p>Now let’s talk a little about the 4x4 system.</p><p>Suzuki uses a viscous coupling that automatically locks when the front wheels spin and sends additional torque to the rear axle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602668052.jpg><p>It’s simple and it works and has been used by Suzuki for more than 20 years.</p><p>On top of that, Hill Descent Control will guide you down a steep slope at a set speed without you touching the pedals.</p><p>Plus, there’s Grip Control — also activated by a switch — which works under 18mph by adding torque to wheels with grip and braking the wheel that is spinning.</p><p>While we’re being technical, the 12-volt hybrid system is as mild as a cold korma but there’s no faffing about with a plug and it does assist a little with torque and lowers emissions.</p><p>It also means that engine restarts in stop/start traffic are smooth and silent — you only hear it when first started from cold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602668024.jpg><p>Other observations. Good visibility. Lots of drink holders. Apple CarPlay. Cruise control. But works best as an A-to-B car.</p><p>You’d get blown around like a crisp packet on a motorway.</p><p>Go for CVT auto if you don’t like manual.</p><p>All in all, this is a clever little box that underlines why Suzuki and Toyota have bought a stake in each other.</p><p>Toyota will make two hybrids for Suzuki based on the RAV4 and Corolla estate.</p><p>The latter will be built at Toyota’s Burnaston plant in Derbyshire.</p><p>Suzuki will share its small-car expertise and supply Toyota with two new models for the Indian market.</p><p>And that concludes today’s lesson. Class dismissed.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key facts: Suzuki Ignis SZ5 Allgrip</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Price: £17,499</p><p><strong>Engine: 1.2litre petrol hybrid</strong></p><p><strong>Power: 83hp, 107Nm</strong></p><p><strong>0-62mph: 12.8 secs</strong></p><p><strong>Top speed: 103mph</strong></p><p><strong>Economy: 52mpg</strong></p><p><strong>CO2: 123g/km</strong></p><p><strong>Out: Now</strong></p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Keyless issues</h2><p><strong>THERE’S an issue with keyless electric cars – and I don’t think it’s just me.</strong></p><p>When you press the button to start them, nothing happens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602668062.jpg><p>So you push the button again – but a bit harder this time – and still nothing.</p><p>So you try for a third time, now a little vexed, and finally the screen flashes and beeps like you’ve put 10p in it.</p><p>It’s the same when you stop at the supermarket.</p><p>You press the same button to switch it off, hop out, and then realise the car is still awake.</p><p>Can you lean over and press the button a bit harder to switch it off? No.</p><p>Because that would be too easy.</p><p>You have to get back in and press it together with the brake pedal.

Calm down.</p><p>I’m on level ground and the gear selector is in Park.</p><p>If you had a sleeping baby in the back, she’d be awake now.</p><p>As you might have guessed, this e-2008 crossover has the same innards as the e-208 hatchback, which means it has the same good and bad.</p><p>Positives: Speed. Zero emissions. Silence. Doddle to drive. Cheap to run.</p><p>Negatives: Price. Range.

I had to borrow my daughter’s Polo.</p><p>It takes half an hour for 80 per cent juice at a 100kW public rapid charger and 7hrs 30mins for a full charge from a 7kW wall-box at home, if you have a drive.</p><p>To be fair, the new 2008 – be it petrol, diesel or pure electric – looks terrific inside and out.</p><p>This GT Line is well-equipped with 10in HD touchscreen, smartphone charging plate, heated seats and all sorts of driver-assistance tech.</p><p>The frameless rear-view mirror is a nice touch and ride quality is fine.</p><p>Most people will be delighted with their new car.</p><p>But I’m not a fan of Peugeot’s signature small steering wheel.</p><p>You have to set it stupidly low or you can’t see the instrument cluster.</p><p>Also, the B-mode for increased braking regeneration when you lift off the accelerator is not strong enough.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>Prices from £29k for the Allure, up to £35k for the GT which has more kit but no more go.
