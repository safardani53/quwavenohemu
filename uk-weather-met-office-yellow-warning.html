train, air and ferry journeys were expected to take longer, with brief power cuts also expected.</p><p>British Airways were forced to ground two dozen domestic and European flights to and from London Heathrow, including multiple links to and from Amsterdam.</p><p>Aberdeen, Edinburgh and <a href=#>Glasgow</a> were also among the routes experiencing cancellations.</p><p>A <a href=#>British Airways spokesperson</a> said: “Due to the high winds forecast as part of Storm Pia, we have made some adjustments to our schedule with as much notice as possible for our customers.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have apologised for the disruption to their travel plans and our teams are working hard to get their journeys back on track as quickly as possible.”</p><p>All trains to and from London Euston were cancelled after overhead electric wires toppled onto the lines at Watford Junction.</p><p>The concourse at Euston was packed with passengers who had hoped to get a train home for Christmas from the station.</p><p>Snaps taken this morning show delayed passengers queuing up at Manchester Airport's Terminal 1.</p><p>Pilots <a href=#>battled to land a diverted plane at Birmingham Airport in 50mph

were already heading towards the Channel Tunnel when they were forced to return to their starting point.</p><p>Dozens more were axed at the last-minute.</p><p>Passengers were urged to make alternative arrangements and apply for refunds, but the Eurostar app crashed amid the surge.</p><p>Furious Frank Knight fumed: "This is properly scandalous.</p><p>"Shame on these people making a misery of Christmas for so many people here in the UK wanting to go back to France for Xmas.</p><p>"Disgusting.... if that's the way you use your right to strike, you should just all lose your jobs."</p><p>Another devastated passenger said: "You’ve just ruined my Christmas.</p><p>"It should have been my first Christmas with my girlfriend, you have ruined everything!"</p><p>One raged: "French unions just reserved a special place in hell.</p><p>"First they strike in the air, now the take us all hostage on train/car via the tunnel. Ferry is also not an option with the storm. This is plain criminal."</p><p>Andy Derbyshire stormed: "How can this happen so suddenly? I am stuck in Paris now with no support and no staff to talk to.</p><p>"What was the contingency plan?"</p><p>Gutted Andrew Hinton, 67, of north Wales, was heading to Brussels with his wife to enjoy the festivities with their son and his family.</p><p>The dad-of-three said: "I’ve just had to book a flight from Heathrow to Brussels.</p><p>"We are totally frustrated, having organised this several weeks ago.</p><p>"We've lost a day of our Christmas break with the family."</p><p>Student Jennifer McCann, 23, of Egham, Surrey, was hoping to surprise her family in Frankfurt by travelling home for Christmas.</p><p>But she said: "I don't know what I'm going to do now.

They have no idea I’m coming back."</p><p>The M20 coastbound carriageway between Junctions 8 and 9 was also temporarily closed due to suspended Eurotunnel services, Kent Police said.</p><p>The "emergency measure" will allow freights bound for the continent to queue on the empty section of motorway to minimise disruption.</p><p>Last night, a Eurostar spokesman said: "Due to&nbsp;a last-minute strike by Eurotunnel staff, no Channel Tunnel crossings have taken place since 21 December, midday. Unfortunately, this means 30 Eurostar trains have been cancelled out of London, Paris or Brussels until the end of the day.</p><p>"For passengers due to travel tomorrow, Eurostar will update them directly with any changes to services from 1900UK/2000CET.</p><p>"Customers who have been affected today have received direct communication about their journey and had the option to exchange their tickets free of charge or claim a refund.</p><p>"Eurostar is closely monitoring the situation as it evolves and is being kept informed of developments by Eurotunnel.</p><p>"Although the situation is out of Eurostar’s control, all our teams are working to minimise the impact on our customers and provide as much support as possible.
