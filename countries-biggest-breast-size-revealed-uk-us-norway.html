and size when you were younger, most women have learnt not to compare their boobs to their mates and celebs.</p><p>But have you ever wondered how your cup size ranks compared to other countries?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

out, by ranking average <a href=#>breast sizes</a> across the world.</p><p>They used data on bra sizes to determine the size of women's <a href=#>knockers</a>.</p><p>According to the statistics, women in Norway topped the chart with an average cup size of C-D.</p><p>Luxembourg, <a href=#>Iceland</a> and the US took up the next three spots, with <a href=#>C-cup</a> sized boobs.</p><p>And women in the UK ranked fifth, again with a C-cup average.</p><p>Meanwhile, women in Vietnam had the smallest boobs according to researchers' analysis, with an AA average.</p><p>The Germany-based research team compiled the dataset by combing through surveys on cup sizes from more than 80 countries.</p><p>As six different bra size systems are used worldwide, they converted them into US sizing to allow for comparison between nations.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>The researchers from <a aria-label="worlddata.info (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worlddata.info</a> also collected information on the average body mass index (BMI) for women in each country and found that countries with a larger BMI average also had correspondingly larger breast sizes.</p><p>"Overall, it is striking that increased breast sizes often occur in countries where obesity is also a problem," the team wrote.</p><p>They added: "The female breast consists to a large extent of fatty tissue and glands.</p><p>"The shape of the breasts also depends not only on genetic factors, but also on the fat content and composition of the connective tissue."</p><p>When analysing why there were such striking variations between boob sizes across different countries, researchers determined it must be down to genetics and climate.</p><p>"In particularly hot regions, the body consumes far greater amounts of energy to cool itself and keep the body's functions in balance," the study authors explained.</p><p>"The breast consists for the most part of fatty tissue, i.e. the body's own energy store.</p><p>"If the energy is quickly withdrawn from the body, no fat tissue can form."</p><p>Finally, researchers noted that in many cases, the size of women's <a href=#>bra</a> cups had little to do with the actual size of their boobs.</p><p>"The most common reason for this is that women often wear a bra that is too small with a correspondingly larger chest band," they explained.</p><p>Researchers noted that in poorer countries, women might not be access a bra that fits them due to financial reasons.</p><p>Whereas in "more developed countries, women are more likely to use the services of specialist shops", resulting in better bra fits.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>It comes after scientists cracked the formula for what makes <a href=#>the ideal set of knockers</a>, by analysing the characteristics of breasts most valued by plastic surgery patients and the general public.</p><p>And GP Philippa Kaye recently put together an <a href=#>ultimate breast guide</a> for The Sun, from how both men and women can find lumps and bumps in their boobs, to how your ta-tas can change throughout your life.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How can I check my own boobs for lumps?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Everybody's boobs are different in terms of size, shape and consistency.</p><p>One of your breasts can be bigger than the other, and the way they feel could change at different times of the month.</p><p>For example, you might have tender and lumpy breasts, especially near the armpit,&nbsp;around the time of your period.</p><p>And after the menopause, they might feel softer, less firm and not as lumpy.</p><p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NHS</a>&nbsp;recommends you get used to these changes so you can recognise when something doesn't look or feel normal for you.</strong></p><p>You should look at your boobs and feel each one, from your armpit up to your collarbone.</p><p>You may find it easiest to do this in the shower or bath, by running a soapy hand over each breast.</p><p>You should:</p><ul><li>feel around the breast in a circular motion</li><li>feel under your arm</li><li>feel behind the nipple</li></ul><p>You can also look at your breasts in the mirror. Look with your arms by your side and also with them raised.</p><p>If you notice anything that isn't normal for you, speak to your GP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIV0g5Rvamxnk6TCr8DRopysZZKetKix0q1km6qVlsC1edKisZ5loprDpq3LnptmrZtiwrR5zaipsJmpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melissa-riverss-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Melissa Riverss Boyfriend: Who is Melissa Rivers Dating?</span></a>
