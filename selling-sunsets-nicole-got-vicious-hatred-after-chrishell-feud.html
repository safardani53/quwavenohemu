I am so humbled and grateful 🙏🙏 Love you both sooooooo much!” Nicole, 31, captioned an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post on Monday, May 22, which featured several photos of the bash thrown for her by pals.</p><p>The real estate agent went on to address the backlash she received following her onscreen feud with <a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a>.</p><p>“The vicious hatred I’ve received from strangers stings a lot less when surrounded by the ARMY of loyal friends and family who love and support me, lift me up and most importantly, know who I really am,” she added. “At the end of the day, that’s all that matters ❤️❤️❤️.”</p><p>In the comments section, former Selling Sunset star <a href=#><strong>Christine Quinn</strong></a> showed her support, writing, “You deserve everything 🌺 🥹 I love you.” (The OG cast member, 34, departed ahead of season 6 <a href=#>after falling out with several coworkers</a> — including Chrishell, 41.)</p><p>During the new season, which started streaming on Friday, May 19, Nicole <a href=#>found herself at odds with Chrishell</a> after claiming she only got real estate listings because their boss<a href=#><strong> Jason Oppenheim</strong></a> had a crush on her.</p><p>The Kentucky native, who dated Jason, 46, for several months in 2021 following her split from <a href=#><strong>Justin Hartley</strong></a>, slammed the accusations and <a href=#>later claimed Nicole was on drugs — which her costar denied</a>.</p><p>While filming season 6, Chrishell <a href=#>sparked speculation of a feud when she threw shade</a> on social media. “The thirst for camera time on season 6 is REAL. Wow. That was insanity,” the former soap actress wrote via Instagram Story in August 2022. “But also SO transparent. Get your 15mins girl but leave my business out of it 🤡.”</p><p>She added: “Screenshots have been archived for this very moment. Of COURSE you have a huge issue with me now — not before — when you have a camera crew around you. I hate fake 💩. If you want camera time — JUST SAY THAT. I would have helped you get the right angle. But don’t try to come for people I love or my business when you were added and I was there to hype you up, excited for you.”</p><p>Chrishell concluded with a note for her followers: “You guys are smart. I think you will see who is in need of attention & willing to throw anyone under the bus to get that 15 mins.”</p><p>During the season, she confirmed the post <a href=#>was about Nicole when she discussed their issues</a>. “A couple of years ago, Jason added both Nicole and I onto a listing. And Nicole didn’t think that I deserved any credit when the house sold because I was a fairly new agent. And she felt like she did a lot more work than I did,” she recalled before telling her costars she hinted at the drama on social media. “Even though I did show the house to multiple buyers, and I held open houses.”</p><p>After the show started streaming, the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> contestant <a href=#>shared screenshots from an alleged conversation between her and Nicole</a> before cameras started rolling. In the messages, which Chrishell posted on Friday, Nicole reached out for advice after being offered a spot on the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You’re obviously a pro and have everything show-realized figured out, so I’d absolutely love to learn some of your wisdom before jumping into the deep end,” Nicole allegedly wrote. “I’m not going to lie, I’m f—king terrified!”</p><p>Selling Sunset season 6 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqepJyeu6h50q6lrJ2kqHqvtcKoo55ll6TBbsLInKCoraNitaLA0Z6bZpmWqbKzecKhqaKrmJq5rXnFnqydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jess-impiazzi-towie-model-naked-actress.html><span>←</span><span>I'm not a glamour model prancing around naked any more, I'm an actress, says Big Brother's Jess Impi</span></a>
