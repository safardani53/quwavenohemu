There is no empirical evidence to back up those claims, which is why you resort to anecdotes frequently,” said HasanAbi, referring to Tate’s comment on how women couldn’t drive. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Twitch star added the kickboxing champion’s opinions were “not common sense” but just “personal opinions.”&nbsp;</p><p>Tate agreed and replied that one could arrive at the truth from an internet study, but the truth of life was the truth that one experienced as an individual, and that was the only truth that everyone&nbsp;lived within.</p><h2>HasanAbi Questions Andrew Tate’s Business Practices</h2><p>After that, the duo switched the conversation to Tate’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">business practices</a>, and things got heated.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>HasanAbi and Andrew Tate debate on a live Twitch stream.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>HasanAbi opined that Tate’s Hustler’s University was a “controversial pyramid scheme” and accused him of brainwashing young boys using manipulation techniques.&nbsp;</p><p>The streamer then asked the businessman to clear up his business model, but Tate’s friends&nbsp;asked him to leave the stream instead of providing answers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Tate and his friends continuously called the streamer boring and asked him to get off the call.</p><p>The streamer accused Tate of avoiding his questions, to which he replied he didn’t owe him any answers as the streamer was not the police.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After that, one of Tate's friends ended the call, leading HasanAbi to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>&nbsp;that Tate's "frame shattered"&nbsp;when confronted with his beliefs and practices. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmemb%2Bmw4ytmK2dXZ2utK3NZqeio5WneqWxwZqrnmaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jane-leeves-eating-disorder.html><span>←</span><span>Her Height, Weight, and More</span></a>
