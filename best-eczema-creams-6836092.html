We applied it daily to our arms, legs, and hands after showering. We noticed an immediate improvement after the first application, noting the soothing and hydrating feeling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This lotion leans on colloidal oatmeal to relieve itchiness and irritation<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=9></span> and thermal spring water to calm and heal damaged skin.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=10></span> It also contains shea butter and glycerin, a couple of Dr. Garlapati's go-tos for sealing in moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a consistency like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>night cream</a>, the formula is somewhat thick, which can make it hard to spread. It's slightly greasy, too, but overall, we like the silky consistency and appreciate how quickly it absorbs. It feels like a luxurious experience to apply this cream, though it’s available at drugstores. Not only does this product soothe inflammation and smooth uneven texture, but it also leaves you with hydrated skin that lasts all day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Colloidal oatmeal, thermal spring water, shea butter, glycerin | <strong>Amount:</strong> 6.8 ounces</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-runner-up-cerave-eczema-relief-creamy-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Runner Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CeraVe Eczema Relief Creamy Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CeraVe Eczema Relief Creamy Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nlsV01mTh6JT_aMl7F0J5skMyI0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cerave-eczema-relief-creamy-oil-41e1079391c649c0a8f71201dd8403f3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Instant soothing relief upon first application thanks to colloidal oatmeal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Feels lightweight on the skin and absorbed easily with minimal need for rubbing in</p></li><li readability=0><p>Long-term hydration helps heal stubborn flairs instantly and over time with nourishing safflower oil and ceramides</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Great value for the 8 ounces of product that comes in the bottle (plus a little goes a long way)</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a product that gets to work fast, then this oil-cream hybrid from CeraVe might be just the thing. This impressive lotion calmed our skin instantly (thanks to soothing colloidal oatmeal), and with the help of ceramides, it hydrated and protected our delicate skin, too. The immediate effects of this cream were beyond compare, and we found even more relief in the next few days of application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cream had particular success in treating a flareup on the hands and fingers in our testing process, which can be a stubborn area to treat because of hand and dishwashing. We found immediate relief with this CeraVe cream, which has a beautiful texture that feels somewhere between a lightweight lotion and a thick cream. And while we were absolutely blown away with the short term relief, we were even more shocked by the long term results. Within one day of initial application, the flare was visibly reduced. Within a few, it was almost entirely gone. That’s right: gone.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the CeraVe cream makes use of safflower oil (and has the word oil in the name), we didn’t find the texture oily at all. It absorbed well once worked into the skin and left behind a smooth feeling that wasn’t sticky to the touch. If you’re looking for a cream that you actually look forward to applying, then this one is definitely worth it’s weight in gold.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, this cream is so great that we really couldn’t find anything that we didn’t absolutely love about it!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Colloidal oatmeal, ceramides | <strong>Amount:</strong> 8 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-vaseline-clinical-care-eczema-calming-therapy-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vaseline Clinical Care Eczema Calming Therapy Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vaseline Clinical Care Eczema Calming Therapy Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MtQWpQFP4CcydlL0LyEV-aEUuOk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vaseline-clinical-care-eczema-calming-therapy-cream-766bf1a557f94afd9010642b9abe7c5d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Performed as well as some of the most expensive options</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Easily absorbs without leaving behind any greasy finish<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Doesn't sting or burn on cracked skin</p></li><li readability=0><p>Provided immediate soothing relief on stubborn flare-ups on our hands thanks to soothing colloidal oatmeal</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The texture of this affordable cream is similar to melted ice cream, but despite the lightweight consistency, this stuff works.

It feels slightly wet on the skin immediately after application, but after about a minute, we found that it absorbed completely without a tacky or clumpy feel. Perhaps best of all, this cream didn’t sting or burn upon application in our tests — even on sensitive, cracked skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The product comes in tube packaging that makes it easy to squeeze out large globs of cream at a time, but it can also be a bit messy because of the cream’s watery texture. Overall, our tests proved that the Vaseline Clinical Care Eczema cream is well worth its pocket-friendly price.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Vaseline jelly, glycerin, colloidal oatmeal | <strong>Amount:</strong> 3.4 ounces<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-dermadoctor-calm-cool-corrected-eczema-repair-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>DermaDoctor Eczema Repair Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DermaDoctor Calm Cool Corrected Eczema Repair Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/90x2i9Znra1tSxaEdgLTDU5NDBA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eczema1-fb16872e58be4317ad61462a7e50c293.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DermaDoctor</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>Rich, smooth consistency feels nourishing yet lightweight enough to apply to the delicate eye area</p></li><li readability=0><p>Immediate improvement on our stubborn flare-ups, including behind the knees and under the eye</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Accepted by National Eczema Association</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're willing to spend a bit more on a formula that actually lives up to its claims, DermaDoctor won't let you down. This luxuriously rich eczema cream calls on colloidal oatmeal<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=11></span> and ceramides<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=12></span> to soothe, protect, and hydrate the skin.

We found that this affordable body lotion not only brought instant hydration, but also prevented our skin from drying out. Its hero ingredient is petrolatum, one of the emollients Dr. Garlapati recommends for eczema.

This formula looked a bit streaky on the skin, but with a little extra rubbing, we could rub the cream in so that it left a finish that we’d describe as greasy, which might feel nice overnight but bothersome during your day-to-day. But, overall, this convenient travel-sized tube is small enough to clear TSA and works to clear up eczema flare-ups.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Ceramides, colloidal oatmeal, golden spent barley, quercetin | <strong>Amount:</strong> 1.7 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-an-eczema-cream></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying an Eczema Cream</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Emollients and Humectants<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Garlapati, the best eczema creams contain protective, lubricating emollients and humectants, which draw water in from the air to keep the skin hydrated. This includes petrolatum, shea butter, squalane, ceramides, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid. "These ingredients work to rehydrate, repair, and maintain the normal skin barrier, which is defective in eczema," she says. She adds that they also aid in reducing dry, irritated, and inflamed skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Soothing and Healing Ingredients<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Garlapati is also a fan of colloidal oatmeal for eczema.
