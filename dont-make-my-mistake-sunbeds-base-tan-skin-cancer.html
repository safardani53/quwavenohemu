Evidence shows people who are frequently exposed to UV rays before the age of 25 are at greater risk of developing skin cancer later in life.</p><p>Sunbeds, sunlamps and tanning booths give out the same type of harmful radiation as sunlight. UVA rays make up about 95 per cent of sunlight.</p><p>They can cause your skin to age prematurely, making it look coarse, leathery and wrinkled. UVB rays make up about 5 per cent of sunlight and burn your skin.</p><p>A tan is your body's attempt to protect itself from the damaging effect of UV rays. Skin cells create pigment (the brown colour) for protection.</p><p>Using a sunbed to get a tan is not safer than tanning in the sun.</p><p>It may even be more harmful, depending on factors such as: the strength of UV rays from the sunbed, how often you use a sunbed, the length of your sunbed sessions, your skin type and your age.</p><p>Just 20 minutes on one is comparable to four hours in the sun – with many stronger than Mediterranean rays at midday.</p><p>It’s part of the reason the World Health Organisation has deemed sunbeds are as dangerous as smoking.</p><p>Anyone can get skin cancer and melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK.</p><p>There are more than 16,000 cases a year and approximately 2,300 deaths.</p><p>Read more on The Sun's <a href=#>Dying For A Tan</a>&nbsp;campaign.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxyhJNxZ25uZmSxsLrTZqSao5Viurp5zKKqrZmbmnq0wc2bnJ2rXZeutLGMrZinZaOgtq95wpqlnJ2iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./50-cent-cuban-link-pda-photos-red-carpet.html><span>←</span><span>50 Cent &amp;amp; Cuban Link Cozy Up On Red Carpet After He Supports Trump Hollywood Life</span></a>
