She is the executive producer for the show, much like her role in the&nbsp;Shadow and Bone&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix</a> adaptation. Unlike&nbsp;Shadow and Bone, Leigh will serve as a writer on the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Leigh Bardugo (@lbardugo)</a></p></figure><p>A Ninth House television adaptation was announced by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>&nbsp;in 2019, less than two days after the book was released. Reportedly, HBO and <a href=#>Hulu</a> were both interested in snatching up an adaptation of the book, which triggered a bidding war after 350,000 copies were ordered for its first print run. Pouya Shahbazian (the&nbsp;Divergent&nbsp;film series), head of film and TV at New Leaf, will serve as a fellow executive producer.</p><p>At present, there is no set release date for the Ninth House television show, as Leigh has only begun to write the script. Hopefully, fans will get an announcement from Amazon by the end of summer when Leigh intends to end her social media hiatus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Leigh still be working on 'Shadow and Bone' Season 2?</h2><p>As noted in her Instagram post, Leigh is, as they say, booked and busy. She confirmed that she will not only be writing the&nbsp;Ninth House&nbsp;television adaptation but also the sequel to&nbsp;Ninth House, as well as continuing work as executive producer on&nbsp;<a href=#>Shadow and Bone&nbsp;Season 2.</a>&nbsp;Recently, it was confirmed that&nbsp;Shadow and Bone&nbsp;was renewed for a second season, and the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second season has already been written</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Leigh Bardugo (@lbardugo)</a></p></figure><p>Hopefully, with Season 2 pre-written, Leigh can turn her full attention to&nbsp;Ninth House&nbsp;and its sequels. Fans have been eager for a sequel to&nbsp;Ninth House, which is anticipated to be a five-book series (the first book in the series arrived in 2019). Perhaps there will be one book per season? Fans can only hope!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Leigh Bardugo (@lbardugo)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is in the 'Ninth House' cast?</h2><p>With the&nbsp;Ninth House&nbsp;script recently underway, it's safe to say all casting announcements likely won't happen for a while. It's also safe to say that whoever ends up in the roles of the main characters will have large shoes to fill, especially in the hearts of fans who swooned over mysterious (and dreamy) Daniel Arlington, or "Darlington."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Leigh Bardugo (@lbardugo)</a></p></figure><p>There is a lot yet to be decided about the&nbsp;Ninth House&nbsp;television series, but fans are excited it's finally happening. And 2022 could be the year of Leigh Bardugo, with&nbsp;Shadow and Bone&nbsp;Season 2 anticipated for that time frame, a new&nbsp;Ninth House&nbsp;book on the way, and the&nbsp;Ninth House&nbsp;TV show kicking into gear. No matter what your favorite Leigh Bardugo work is, it might be brought to life soon enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Shadow and Bone&nbsp;Season 1 is now available for streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7avwMdmn6ito5p6tcKMrJ%2Borw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-truth-car-seat-mot.html><span>←</span><span>Im a mechanic the truth behind whether a car seat can fail your MOT</span></a>
