In a <a href=#>sneak peek</a> of the Monday, June 26, premiere, the 24-year-old California native begins his Bachelorette journey on a memorable note after sharing a kiss with Lawson, 27, at the Bachelor Mansion.</p><p>In the clip, Brayden kicks off their one-on-one conversation by sharing that he was “stoked” to learn that Charity was going to be The Bachelorette’s <a href=#>next leading lady</a>. She returns his kind words by saying, “I acknowledge how scary of a process this can be, so I thank you for being here.”</p><p>After noting that she’s “so happy” to have him on her journey for love, the pair enjoyed a sweet kiss — though neither realized their intimate moment was witnessed by a handful of contestants. “Brayden went for a kiss,” one of them states, while another said watching the moment left him with a “s—t feeling.”</p><p>The kiss leaves Brayden feeling joyful, much to his fellow contestants’ displeasure. “I got a kiss, bro. She kissed me,” he unknowingly tells Charity’s older brother <strong>Nehemiah</strong>, who is in disguise as a Bachelor Mansion bartender.</p><p>Several of the men interpreted Brayden’s excitement for bragging. “He was feeling cocky, really putting their time out there,” one contestant says in a confessional. “[He was] definitely mouthing off.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Who-Is-Brayden-Bowers-5-Things-to-Know-About-the-Bachelorette-Season-20-Contestant5.jpg><p>Their suspicions may prove to be correct as Brayden believes he has Charity’s <a href=#>first impression rose</a> in the bag. “Oh my goodness. I’m just ready for that first impression rose, though,” he tells another suitor.</p><p>For one contestant, Brayden’s actions are enough to <a href=#>warrant his elimination</a>. “I’m like, good job. You got a kiss, but told everyone,” he says in a confessional. “I think it’s disrespectful for the rest of the guys. You need to get the f—k out.”</p><p>While fans will have to tune in to see whether Brayden survives the first elimination, Charity exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> what she was looking for in a man headed into this season.</p><p>“I’m open to dating anyone and any type. So I think they took that quite literally and I’m so grateful for that,” the Georgia native explained. “But also I did make the conscious effort to emphasize too, ‘I definitely want a diverse cast.’ We have seen in the past that it’s kind of just the standard type of men — or girls as well. But definitely wanted to add that diversity piece and also the inclusivity piece of it all. You’ll see that with a lot of the guys and they’re all great.”</p><p>Charity — who previously appeared on <a href=#><strong>Zach Shallcross</strong></a>’ season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> — also revealed that she fell in love <a href=#>with more than one of her contestants</a>. “It definitely is possible considering circumstances and how much time we have to really just, like, truly focus on these connections, it is definitely possible [and] something I actually did not think was gonna ever happen,” she shared.</p><p>Scroll down to get to know the Bachelorette season 20 contestant:</p><p>The Bachelorette season 20 premieres on ABC Monday, June 26, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h2>1.
