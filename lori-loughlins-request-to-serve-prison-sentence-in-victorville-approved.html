She is ordered to surrender to the facility no later than 2 p.m. on November 19, 2020.</p><p>The Victorville facility has a low-security prison camp for 300 inmates where Loughlin would serve her time.</p><p>The When Calls the Heart star was sentenced in August to serve two months in prison, two years of supervised release, 100 hours of community service and pay a $150,000 fine for her part in <a href=#>the nationwide college admissions scandal</a>. Her husband, <a href=# rel><strong>Mossimo Giannulli</strong></a>, was sentenced to five months in prison, two years of suspended release, a $250,000 fine and 250 hours of community service. They were found guilty of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.</p><p>The pair <a href=#>were arrested in March 2019</a> after they were accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters, <a href=# rel><strong>Bella Giannulli</strong> </a>and <a href=# rel><strong>Olivia Jade Giannulli</strong></a>, into the University of Southern California as crew recruits even though they do not compete in the sport.</p><p>Loughlin<a href=#> got emotional</a> as she addressed the judge <a href=#>at her sentencing on August 21</a>.</p><p>“I made an awful decision. I went along will the plan to give my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process,” she said during the virtual hearing as she sat next to attorney Sean Berkowitz. “In doing so, [I] ignored my intuition and allowed myself to be swayed from my moral compass. I thought I was acting out of love for my children, but in reality, I had only undermined and diminished my daughters’ abilities and accomplishments.”</p><p>“While I wish I could go back and do things differently, I can only take responsibility and move forward,” <a href=#>she said as her voice shook</a>. “I have great faith in God and I believe in redemption and I will do everything in my power to redeem myself and use this experience as a catalyst to do good and give back for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Wiping tears from her eyes, she added that she was “profoundly and deeply sorry” and “ready to face the consequences and make amends.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With reporting by Marjorie Hernandez</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6Keeq271KCfpaGeqHqzsdCunKysXam8br%2FEq62eZaCntrS7zWaqnqakmruksYyipWaumZjBsL7VoqOlnV2WvbG%2Bzq%2BcnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dance-moms-season-6-episode-6-recap-kendyl-and-lynn-flay-vs-ever.html><span>←</span><span>Kendyl and Lynn Flay vs. Everyone!</span></a>
