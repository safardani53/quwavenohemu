One scene in the third episode had fans all wondering the same thing — is the penis real in Sex/Life? The scene in question involves actor <a href=#>Adam Demos</a>, who plays Brad, in a shower scene at the gym.</p><p>In season 2, viewers see Devon (played by Jonathan Sadowski) pumping up his penis following an accident that has left him with a new member, and it raised the same question: is that penis real?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When the season 1 episode initially dropped on the streaming platform, viewers had lots of questions and many were surprised at the addition of male full-frontal nudity in a Netflix show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is the penis real in 'Sex/Life' Season 1?</h2><p>In Episode 3, Adam Demos's Brad and Mike Vogel's Cooper are both in a communal shower at the gym. When Cooper gets a look at Brad's penis, he's none too pleased since Brad is also Cooper's wife's ex. And he's so displeased because the guy's penis is pretty large. So large, in fact, that when the episode originally dropped, viewers were sure it was prosthetic.</p><p>In July 2021, Sex/Life showrunner Stacy Rukeyser told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a> that, at the 19:50 mark in that episode, you aren't just seeing the illusion of a very well-endowed actor.</p><p>"That's not a body double," she told the outlet. "I mean, people usually ask, 'is it real or is it a prosthetic?'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>She added, "I can tell you what Adam Demos says about it, which is, 'a gentleman never tells.' So, we are leaving that up to the viewer's imagination."</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a> reported that a member of the show's prosthetics team confirmed a prosthetic was used in that particular scene. So if that's true, then it appears viewers may finally have their answer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is that Jonathan's real penis in 'Sex/Life' Season 2?</h2><p>While on a downward spiral following his split from Billie, Cooper decides to take a boy's night out with Devon...and it ends in disaster.</p><p>They do drugs, spend the night with sex workers, and wind up in separate cars while still under the influence. Cooper, who is receiving oral sex while driving, crashes into Devon's car and gets injured (down below).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Devon undergoes penile surgery, gains an inch in the process, and reveals his prosthetic penis (which he is very proud of) to Cooper. He can pump it up to gain an erection, which he demonstrates.</p><p>It has yet to be confirmed whether Jonathan is wearing a prosthetic, but, if Adam was given the luxury to sport a prosthetic, it's likely that Jonathan was too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much nudity is there in 'Sex/Life'?</h2><p>Because Sex/Life is sexually charged and it's about a housewife's exploration of sex and potentially finding it outside of her marriage, there is a fair bit of nudity in the show. Typically, it's the female form.</p><p>But, as we see with Episode 3, the nudity doesn't end there. Sarah told Collider it's not about gratuitous nudity, however, but instead meant to add to the story.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay if that penis in Sex/Life wasn’t a prosthetic, I can only hope that homeboy isn’t a grower as well as a shower cause he could probably kill someone with that thing</p>— Sauvignon Blonde™️ (@CathInTheBath) <a href=#>June 28, 2021</a></figure><p>She also shared with the outlet that viewers tend to see the male body a bit longer on Sex/Life because for the main character, Billie, "that's her gaze, that's her experience of it."</p><p>Watch Sex/Life on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMeeZKmdnp7Abr7EmqNmp55iwKbEjKWgn50%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-rob-stone-dating-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Rob Stone Dating Now</span></a>
