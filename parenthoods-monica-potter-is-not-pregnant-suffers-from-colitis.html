I‚Äôm not pregnant but wanted to shed some light on some issues we all may deal with, especially women. It‚Äôs never really talked about because it‚Äôs not sexy, pretty, our glamorous to say the least, so I decided to share a photo to possibly inspire my friends (you), create a platform to share stories, and rely on each other for support and guidance. I‚Äôve had colitis for almost 2 years and sometimes when I get flareups it‚Äôs painful and frustrating, so for all of you who suffer from colitis or other abdominal issues, please know you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôm going for a check up on Friday and following up with colonoscopy this month. I want to stress the importance of getting regular check-ups with your gastroenterologist or family physician. I hope this open discussion will lead to many other things we face as women, mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and every role we take on. Take time for yourself and go get checked. Even if you‚Äôre not having issues it‚Äôs important. Please note that I am not sponsored by anyone but me ‚Äì I did this on my own, and just wanted to share. That being said, a huge thank you to these foundations that are bringing awareness and guidance to all of us for better healthüíú #colon #colonoscopy #colitis #ulcerativecolitis #americanmedicalassociation #clevelandclinic #crohncolitisawareness #crohnsdisease #livehealthy #womenshealth #prevention #health</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Monica Potter</a> (@monicapottergram) on Jan 18, 2018 at 6:09am PST</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Potter is mom of daughter Molly, 12, with husband Daniel Christopher Allison.
