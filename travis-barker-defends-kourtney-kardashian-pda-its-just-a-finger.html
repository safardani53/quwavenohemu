But we certainly don’t blame the guy!</p><p>Might as well cash in on the public’s fascination with his personal life!</p><p>Anyway, one of Travis’ followers rudely pointed out that pics of Barker without Kourt by his side are a rarity these days:</p><p>“No kardashian finger up the ass, tongue, intestines, nudity, pda, etc etc anymore?
