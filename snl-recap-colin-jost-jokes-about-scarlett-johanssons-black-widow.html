And If you asked me, you’re an even better Black Widow than Coretta Scott King.”</p><p class=p1>Jost then rested his head in his hands while sitting next to an unimpressed special guest, who was playing a character named <strong>Hattie Davis</strong>. (Davis was <a href=#>a fictional civil rights activist</a>, whom Che, 40, enlisted for his portion of the joke swap to disapprove of Jost’s speech.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snl-recap-colin-jost-jokes-about-scarlett-johanssons-black-widow-03.jpg><p class=p1>Jost and Che have <a href=#>helmed “Weekend Update”</a> since 2014’s season 40. To ring in the holiday season, they <a href=# rel>exchange jokes live on air</a> — and neither comic knows what the other has written. The jokes have since become a source of discomfort for Johansson.</p><p class=p1>“I now rarely watch [<i>SNL</i>] without having a sense of … not overwhelming panic, just like a slight underwhelming panic because I just feel like at any moment something’s going to fall apart,” Johansson said during a July 2021 episode of <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show. </i>“And that’s the excitement of <i>SNL</i> and for all audiences, right? Because it’s absolutely live.”</p><p class=p1>Johansson added: “But when you’re emotionally invested in it and not just entertained by it, it takes on a little bit of a different life.”</p><p class=p1>The actress met Jost when she hosted an episode of <i>SNL</i> before they started dating in 2017. Two years later, <a href=#>Jost proposed</a> before <a href=#>they wed in 2020</a>. Jost and Johansson went on to <a href=#>welcome their son, Cosmo,</a> in August 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snl-recap-colin-jost-jokes-about-scarlett-johanssons-black-widow-01.jpg><p class=p1>“Colin is an extremely hands-on dad, he always makes a big fuss over little Cosmo,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in October 2022. “They’re very into their privacy and downtime in the Hamptons, where they have a tight-knit support team and a wonderful laid-back lifestyle that they wouldn’t trade for the world. They’re just a very laid-back, functional pair who have a ton of mutual respect.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Jost also is a stepfather to Johansson’s <a href=#>9-year-old daughter, Rose,</a> whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Romain Dauriac</strong>.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><i>Saturday Night Live</i> airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqnpF2nsqStz2aaqKSZo3qru9KtZKOnm5rAbq3BqKytZaOYrrO4xK2rZqKfna6vv9KopaxlkqGupLeMsKCdp6dk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./your-narrator.html><span>←</span><span>Your Narrator</span></a>
