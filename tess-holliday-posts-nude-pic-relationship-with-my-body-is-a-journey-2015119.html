Outspoken plus-size model <strong>Tess Holliday</strong> isn't afraid to share her feelings on her body with the world, and on Friday, Sept. 11, she posted a completely nude photo on <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share more with fans—and haters, too.</p><p>Looking over her bare shoulder at the camera with her entire body exposed (an "oops!" graphic censored her nipples) the model and mom of one, 30, wrote, "My relationship with my body is a journey, not a destination. I appreciate & honor what it’s done for me, & the life it brought into the world. I couldn’t give a [monkey emoji] if you find me attractive or if my body offends you. #tessholliday #effyourbeautystandards."</p><p>Holliday—who has been named a top plus-size model by Vogue Italia and booked campaigns with major brands like Torrid, Yours Clothing, and Simply Be—has been a passionate advocate for beauty in all sizes, despite haters. Just recently she spoke to <strong>Us Weekly</strong> about a <a href=#>viral Facebook feed that Photoshops famous fuller figures</a> down to stick-thin sizes. "I think it's pathetic… I actually laughed out loud [when I saw the pictures of myself]. The versions of me smaller aren’t even anatomically correct and my limbs are all stretched out like I’m made of Play-Doh," she tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>Holliday has zero time for those who would bring her, or anyone else in her industry, down. "People who do this kind of stuff will never get it. They need to work on their own issues and why they have so much hate and anger first," she continues.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>What do you think of Holliday’s skin-baring snapshot?
