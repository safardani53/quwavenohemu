Most designs are two-slice options, but if you have a big family then you might want to upgrade to a four-slice model.</p><p>If you plan to cook things like bagels or toasties, look for an option with variable width and extra wide slots. The wider slots mean that bigger items can fit in, and metal frames that come together to hold your item in place mean that, even if it’s just a thin piece of toast, it will be in the right position to be browned evenly.</p><h3>Value</h3><p>A decent toaster should have a crumb tray, and buttons for reheat, defrost and cancel — although you might be happy to sacrifice one or two of these functions for a cheaper price.</p><p>Having a range of different shade settings can be important as well. The more numbers there are, the more likely you are to find a shade to suit you.</p><p>Think of what you need and the best price of a toaster which can provide these things for you.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Of course, there's no point splashing out on a fabulous toaster that doesn't suit your colour-scheme and makes you want to hide it in the cupboard.</p><p>Think of your colour scheme and how much space you have to place your gadget.</p><h2>What is the best toaster?</h2><p>It might be easy to immediately think of household names like KitchenAid, Smeg and De'Longhi when deciding on the best toaster around, but in reality, it comes down to your personal needs.</p><p>Some designs are great but they might not go well with your interior aesthetic, whereas others are basic but could be the finishing touch to your dream kitchen.</p><p>Decide on your budget, needs and colour-scheme first of all, then you can find the perfect one for you.</p><p>If you're always reaching for bagels or thick bread from your local bakery (yum) then you're going to need one that has extra thick slots to save slices getting stuck inside.</p><p>Sound a little more complicated than you thought? Don't worry, we've found the best toasters on the market today, whatever you're looking for.</p><p>If you click on a link in this article, we may earn affiliate revenue.</p><h2>We tested: <strong>Breville Edge 2 Slice Toaster - Stainless Steel</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/9528088_R_Z001A.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Breville Edge 2 Slice Toaster - Stainless Steel, £35 from Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>On the cheaper end of the toaster-spectrum is Breville's Edge 2 Slice Toaster at just £35 from Argos.</p><p>The variable slot width allows you to insert both thick and thin slices of bread, and you can choose your browning level, as well as defrosting bread too.</p><p>Our review? It's great and looks more expensive than it is.</p><p>From the super lightweight feel, to the smooth experience, there's nothing bad to say about this no-nonsense toaster.</p><p>Of course, it's nice to have four slots, if you're making breakfast for more than one person, but for £35, you're getting what you pay for.</p><p>If you're doing up your new kitchen, why not buy the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">matching kettle</a> too?</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2>We tested: KitchenAid Artisan 2-Slice Toaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/376-80026680-5KMT2204BCA_CANDYAPPLE_M-e1646391068303.jpeg><ul><li><strong>KitchenAid Artisan 2-Slice Toaster, £199 from Selfridges - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This high-end appliance has everything you might need from a toaster, including the ability to toast just one side of the bagel and make toasted sandwiches.</p><p>There are seven different shades to choose from and a high lift function for those smaller breads.</p><p>As KitchenAid has a strong reputation, we were expecting big things from the Artisan 2-Slice Toaster and it sure looks the part, as a sturdy no-nonsense kitchen appliance.</p><p>All you have to do is place your bread in and then it automatically lowers down, and you have seven different browning settings so you can have your toast exactly how you like it.</p><p>We especially loved toasting a bagel using the bagel setting, because it ensures that the outside isn't toasted. However, there are quite a few cheaper toasters out there which do that too.</p><p>For £199, you're mainly paying for a good looking toaster that is durable, does the job particularly well and toasts your bread specifically to your needs.</p><h2><strong>We tested: Sage The Smart Toast™ 2-Slice Toaster</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-6-e1646387234730.jpg><ul><li><strong>The Smart Toast™ 2-Slice Toaster, £139.95 from Sage - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Ever experienced getting your thick bread slices stuck in the toaster? You can avoid that crumby mess with Sage's Smart Toast™ 2-Slice Toaster because each slot is extra wide.</p><p>Featuring a one-touch automation, this toaster is on the fancy end of the spectrum with an LED strip that tells you how much longer your toast has to go.</p><p>We particularly loved the 'a bit more' button for achieving perfectly-toasted toast, and the eject button is oh-so smooth, giving you a premium experience.</p><p>Whether you need to toast frozen bread or a crumpet/bagel, you can select your browning level and it won't let you down.</p><p>In terms of appearance, it's not too bad either, in a shiny, easy-to-clean silver.</p><p>If you're fed up of never getting it right when it comes to toast, then this is sure to solve all those issues. Is it worth £139.95? Yes, but it depends on whether you care about having a deluxe toasting experience or not.</p><h2>Progress EK4127PBRG Jupiter 2-slice toaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/81A0l0dHtL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Progress EK4127PBRG Jupiter 2-slice toaster, £29.99 from Amazon - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Progress’s compact Jupiter toaster features a stylish matte and high gloss finish with rose gold fixtures. You can also get a matching kettle.</p><p>There are just two slots but they’re wide enough to fit thicker slices of bread, with a compression grill to hold the bread in place so it toasts evenly.</p><p>You have seven different browning shades to choose from, all controlled using the dial on the front. Around the shade dial you also have the reheat, defrost and cancel buttons.</p><p>In testing, we found this budget-friendly toaster did a pretty decent job - our toast was evenly browned and ready very quickly, and when we had to reheat the toast, there was no burning at all. It also had a handy crumb tray at the bottom, so there was no mess.</p><p>It doesn’t have a high lift function though, which means when toasting smaller items, you do have to try and fish it out afterwards - but it’s a minor inconvenience at this price point.</p><h2>Salter EK2652GRG 2-slice toaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91jjE8QdZuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Salter EK2652GRG 2-slice toaster, £36.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>On this toaster there are two wide slots, designed to fit thicker slices of bread, with compression grills to hold them in place.</p><p>In terms of control, there’s a dial on the front with six different shades to choose from. Next to it are three buttons in a row where you can choose to reheat, defrost or cancel. Underneath the appliance you have a hidden crumb tray to catch all the spills.<br>When we tested this toaster it achieved great results and our bread browned evenly. It was also straightforward to use, with all the buttons easily accessible.</p><p>One thing to note: the stainless steel looks very stylish but it can mean a bit more cleaning as your fingerprints will show up.</p><h2>Breville VTT470 Impressions 4-slice toaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2000x2000-e1646388619132.jpg><ul><li><strong>Breville VTT470 Impressions 4-slice toaster, £35 from Sainsburys -

It’s a good idea to give this a wash too, if you haven’t for a while. Washing up liquid followed by a rinse is fine — just make sure it’s dry before you put it back at the end of the clean.</p><p>Next, turn your toaster upside down over a bin or the sink and give it a good shake so any loose crumbs will fall out. Use a sturdy pastry brush to remove any crumbs lodged in the corners. And if you have any stuck on bits of food, use the handle of a wooden spoon to scrape it off and scrub away any debris with a clean toothbrush.</p><p>For the outside, simply give it a wipe down with a dampened microfiber cloth. You can dab on a bit of washing up liquid if it’s greasy but make sure none of it gets inside the toaster. Wipe down with a damp cloth afterward.</p><p>Once your toaster is clean, just slot the crumb tray back in and you’re ready to use it again.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More in Sun Selects Home</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our round-up of the best toasters?
