West, 45, notably <a href=#>called Davidson “Skete”</a> in <a href=#>a series of inflammatory social media disses</a> last year over the comic’s relationship with <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>. (Kardashian, 42, and West <a href=#>were married for six years</a>, separating in 2021, before <a href=#>she moved on with Davidson</a>. They ultimately <a href=#>split in August 2022</a> after several months of dating.)</p><p class=p1>Elsewhere in “I’m Just Pete,” Davidson <a href=#>lamented over his various scandals</a>, rehab stints and even his dating history.</p><p class=p1>“I’m just Pete / My dating life is not discrete,” he added. “I generate tons of publicity for everything except my comedy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pete-Davidson-Hints-He-Cant-Say-Kanye-Wests-Name-During-SNL-Version-of-Barbie-Ballad-01.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Saturday’s</span> episode marked Davidson’s return to the NBC sketch comedy series, which he previously appeared on as a cast member from 2014 to 2022. He was <a href=#>originally set to host in May</a> with musical guest <strong>Lil Uzi Vert</strong>, but his <a href=#>debut was canceled</a> at the time due to the Writers Guild of America strike.</p><p class=p1>Prior to the official announcement that the show would air repeats for the remainder of season 48, Davidson expressed his disappointment over the development.</p><p>“<a href=#><strong>Lorne [Michaels]</strong></a> told me [about hosting] a couple months ago, but then this week, as you know, a writers’ strike might happen,” he explained on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> in April. “So I’ve been working on this for, like, two, three months and they’re like, ‘Yeah, well. We’ll know Monday if it’s happening or not.’”</p><p>“It just sucks because it feeds my weird story I have in my head, like, ‘Of course that would happen to me,’” Davidson added, joking that the effects of the strike were “all about me” instead of the writers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pete-Davidson-Hints-He-Cant-Say-Kanye-Wests-Name-During-SNL-Version-of-Barbie-Ballad-03.jpg><p>Despite the delay, Davidson got a second chance to make his hosting debut alongside musical guest <a href=#><strong>Ice Spice</strong></a> after the <a href=#>WGA voted to officially end the work stoppage</a> in September after five months. While SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors, has been <a href=#>on strike since July</a>, Saturday Night Live was allowed to return because of a special stipulation.</p><p>“SAG-AFTRA members appearing on Saturday Night Live either as hosts, guests or cast members are working under the Network Code agreement, which is not a contract we are striking,” the union said in a statement. “They are not in violation of SAG-AFTRA strike rules, and we support them in fulfilling their contractual obligations.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pete-Davidson-Hints-He-Cant-Say-Kanye-Wests-Name-During-SNL-Version-of-Barbie-Ballad-02.jpg><p>Since departing his role as a Saturday Night Live cast member, Davidson has starred in <a href=#>Bupkis</a>, a Peacock dramedy series loosely based on his life that premiered in May and has been renewed for season 2. He has also <a href=#>continued to do stand-up</a>. During a September stop in Atlantic City on his “Jon, John & Pete” tour with fellow comedians <a href=#><strong>Jon Stewart</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>John Mulaney</strong></a>, Davidson joked about <a href=#>his “post-rehab glow”</a> following reports in June that he was seeking treatment amid his struggles with PTSD and borderline personality disorder.</p><p>Saturday Night Live airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKZdnbavwNJmmK1lm5a7urGMsJysrF2bsrawjKKlZqueoXq0t8StmqFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toddler-died-strep-a-warning.html><span>←</span><span>Our son, 3, collapsed and died while watching cartoons - he had no symptoms heres our warning</span></a>
