Publisher EA separated the furniture piece from the free update released yesterday.</p><p>Players on Reddit were pretty confused by the changing table not being included in the update. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One user</a> had "spent half an hour looking for the changing table" since the adult Sims "kept throwing dirty diapers on the floor."</p><p>"Why give us a baby wipe decoration with no changing table?!" stated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another Reddit poster</a>.
