I really hope CGD gives her a much more fair representation of who she is as a person," Anna continued.</p><p>"And that actually she is what I call a naughty little puppy, you tell her off but with a smile on her face but by the end of it you still want to give her a big cuddle and a kiss.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>"We see this with her dating, Nikita really cares, she’s a really considered dater but she’s picky AF and she’s probably been the hardest to please on CGD."</p><p>Discussing her biggest bugbears, Anna revealed that she gets frustrated when the celebrities come with a preconceived "type on paper".</p><p>"The type-list is one of my absolute bugbears, anyone that comes in with this is my list on paper, if I could throw that list in a fire and spit on it a few times," Anna said.</p><p>"They come in with very limited attitudes around dating and they are neglecting and negating an absolute pool of terrific men purely because they think they want something but in actual fact it’s not what they need.</p><p>"So working with their wants and needs in the dating scenes has been an enormous challenge. With Nikita and Chloe [Brockett], we have definitely seen good progress in one of them and lets just say working progress in the other."</p><p>Nikita was&nbsp;<a href=#>axed from MAFS</a>&nbsp;after just one week following her explosive outbursts at other cast members including husband Ant Poole.</p><p>Nikita is said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade accusing her fellow cast members of only signing up to the show for fame.</p><p><a href=#>Nikita</a>&nbsp;told The Sun: "I am truly gutted to have left the show. I loved every minute of the experience but it was a rollercoaster of emotions, and sometimes they got the better of me.</p><p>"But that’s me as a person and I am truly sorry for any upset I caused during my time in the experiment. However, I will always stand up for what I believe in.</p><p>"I can be loud and lairy, I’ll admit that, but I have try to be a good person and have others backs.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"This can confuse people occasionally.
