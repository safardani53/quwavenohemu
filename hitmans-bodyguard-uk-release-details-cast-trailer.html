UK release details, cast and trailer - all you need to know</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>ACTION comedy The Hitman's Bodyguard has excited film fans with a hilarious first trailer that promises a hilarious buddy flick.</p><p>But what is the film about, who's in it - and does it look like it'll be worth a watch? Here's what we know so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000316551826.jpg><h2>What is The Hitman's Bodyguard about?</h2><p>The film follows the world's top bodyguard, played by <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a>, as he gets a new mission - escorting a notorious hit man, <a href=#>Samuel L. Jackson</a>, to testify at the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.</p><p>There's a lot of bad language and the pair have a love-hate relationship at best - but they will slowly bond as they rush to the Netherlands to testify against a Russian dictator, doing battle with his gun-toting operatives in the process.</p><p>The Hitman's Bodyguard will remind audiences of classic buddy comedies as the two main characters bicker and squabble - and the film boasts exciting action sequences to boot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000316550132.jpg><p>The film was in the 2011 Hollywood 'Black List' of movies - which despite the ominous sounding name, is actually a good thing.</p><p>The term refers to a ranking of the unproduced film scripts most liked by industry insiders. Award-winning blockbusters like American Hustle, Juno, Argo, and Spotlight have previously made the list before going on to critical and public acclaim.</p><p>So being on the Black List could spell great things for the summer comedy film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000316550025.jpg><h2>Is there a trailer?</h2><p>The first trailer for The Hitman's Bodyguard dropped on April 13, 2017, and there will be more to follow.</p><p>It teased a hilarious flick reminiscent of 80's buddy comedies - only with a lot more modern-day sass.</p><p>The two men shouting at each other - screaming "F*** you!" and "Eat my a**" - is backed by the dulcet tones of Whitney Houston singing 'I Will Always Love You'. The pair</p><p>Clearly the hitman, played by Samuel L. Jackson, doesn't appear to appreciate being babysat. But if his antics in the trailer are anything to go by - dangerous driving and running into two oncoming trains - it's a good job he's got one.</p><p>Ryan Reynolds seems set to replicate his gloriously sassy performance in Deadpool, while Samuel L. Jackson's character harks back to his turn as Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction, barking "Mother-f*****!" at his minder and threatening to shoot him.</p><p>The trailer sets up The Hitman's Bodyguard as potentially one of the best comedies of the summer - so we can only hope the next teasers are just as good.</p><h2>Who's in the cast of The Hitman's Bodyguard?</h2><p>The Hitman's Bodyguard boasts a star-studded cast with some fantastic comedy chops between them, so promises to be hilarious.</p><p>Here's the lowdown of all the lead actors.</p><h3>Ryan Reynolds</h3><p>Ryan Reynolds stars as the title character, a bodyguard who is tasked with escorting one of the world's most dangerous bounty hunters to testify at the International Court of Justice.</p><p>It's clear from the trailer Ryan will bring his trademark quick wit to the role</p><p>Ryan has been acting since the 1990's, getting his start in a series of sitcoms, most of which didn't do very well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000299156184.jpg><p>Bizarrely, he hit the big time through a flop film, Blade Trinity. Ryan played a supporting role but he got people talking with his eye-rolling and his hilarious improvised lines that made their way into the final film.</p><p>He is now perhaps best known as the title character in Deadpool, the raunchy and hilarious super-antihero movie that raked in $783 million worldwide and catapulted him to fame. Deadpool 2 is set for release in 2018, while we already know there is a third film to follow.<br></p><h3>Samuel L. Jackson</h3><p>Samuel L. Jackson plays the hitman who Ryan Reynolds has to protect as he travels to the International Court of Justice at the Hague in the Netherlands.</p><p>In the trailer he plays off Reynolds brilliantly, and the two have an easy frenemy rapport as they attempt to navigate their way to the trial of a murderous dictator so he can testify.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000315886716.jpg><p>The role so far looks strikingly similar to his iconic turn in Pulp Fiction - which certainly isn't a bad thing as it propelled him to meteoric fame and many of his lines have become part of the foundations of popular culture.</p><p>Jackson has also famously starred in Die Hard, Shaft, Snakes on a Plane, Marvel's Avengers films, and the Star Wars prequels.<br></p><h3>Gary Oldman</h3><p>Gary Oldman is known for playing villains and criminals, and for a big, physical acting style that stems from his theatrical background.</p><p>With that in mind it's no wonder he is cast as a murderous dictator who is on trial at The Hague. The plot revolves around the need for Samuel L. Jackson's character to testify against him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000312498933.jpg><p>So we can expect him to bring some of his trademark wild physicality to his latest role - and to completely embody the character.</p><p>Oldman has a strong track record in action films - with roles under his belt including Gotham police chief James Gordon in the Dark Knight trilogy, British spy George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Solider Spy, and mobster Floyd Banner in Lawless. However younger viewers may know him simply as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films.<br></p><h3>Salma Hayek</h3><p>Ryan Reynolds' character agrees to babysit Jackson's hitman in exchange for getting his wife out of jail - who is played by <a href=#>Salma Hayek</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000313261345-e1492098706322.jpg><p>It's not yet clear how large Hayek's role in the film will be as the first look trailer focuses on the two leading men.</p><p><a href=#>Hayek, 50,</a> came to prominence with roles in Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, and was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as artist Frida Kahlo in Frida.</p><h3>Elodie Yung</h3><p>French actress Elodie Yung will also play a role in the film, though it's not yet clear what this will be.</p><p>Yung has had a lot of roles in french films, but UK fans might recognise her from Marvel Netflix series Daredevil, in which she plays the title character's girlfriend, Elektra Natchios.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000316546526.jpg><h2>When does The Hitman's Bodyguard come out in the UK?</h2><p>The Hitman's Bodyguard is currently in post-production as the film's producers prepare for its release.</p><p>It will arrive in UK cinemas on August 18, 2017.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhrY2eDcXyTaJ%2BirJ2Wu7R5waibsp%2Bllr%2BledSkZKudnJqutLGMnZytmZmhwG6vwKyrZqyilratsdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./serena-williams-alexis-ohanians-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanians Relationship Timeline</span></a>
