Well, that’s what everyone thought before April 7, when it was reported that an alleged eye witness saw her hit him over the head with a pole! The two reportedly got into a “public brawl” according to an Instagram user who apparently saw the whole thing go down. A friend of Safaree’s implied that he had been hospitalized, and Star took to Snapchat to speak out about the ordeal. And, after listening to her to her latest Snapchat on April 7 — where she had zero sympathy for Safaree — it sounded like she may have had something to do with his&nbsp;alleged injury. You can listen to that, right here, and check out five key things to know about Star, below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. Star&nbsp;is speculated to be a cast member on Love & Hip Hop Hollywood.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The show’s 4th season is set to premiere in April 2017, and it’s been reported that Star has been filming with the cast and that she will become a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>series regular</a>. Her on-again, apparently, now, off-again boyfriend, Safaree is already a cast member on L&HHH.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. She’s referred to as the “West Coast&nbsp;Barbie”.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Star has gained notoriety for her signature pink locks, seen in our photos above, although she’s currently brunette. And, a lot of social media users have pointed out that it’s pretty ironic that Safaree’s ex, N<strong>icki Minaj</strong>, 32, is referred to as “Pink Barbie”. Similarities, similarities…</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BQhS9Q3j7BH/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>3.
