He was most known for his time in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE</a>, where he wrestled under the ring name Bray Wyatt from 2010 until 2021 and then again from 2022 until his death in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Wyatt was a third-generation wrestler, following in the traditions of his grandfather, Blackjack Mulligan, father, Mike Rotunda, and two uncles, Barry Windham and Kendall Windham. Taylor Rotunda, better known as Bo Dallas, is his younger brother and a professional wrestler.&nbsp;</p><p>He and his brother held the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice while wrestling in WWE’s then-developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) between 2008 and 2012.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just received a call from WWE Hall of Famer Mike Rotunda who informed us of the tragic news that our WWE family member for life Windham Rotunda – also known as Bray Wyatt – unexpectedly passed earlier today. Our thoughts are with his family and we ask that everyone respect their…</p>— Triple H (@TripleH) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 24, 2023</a></figure><p>Unfortunately, Wyatt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">died</a> of a heart attack on August 24, 2023, in Clermont, Florida, at the age of 36. WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H confirmed his death on Twitter.</p><p>It was reported that Wyatt had been suffering from an unidentified disease since February, which was considered life-threatening. According to accounts from days before his death, he was progressing well towards recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>It was discovered shortly after his death that the sickness was COVID-19, which had aggravated a pre-existing cardiac issue. He is survived by his parents, siblings, and children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barry Wyatt’s parents&nbsp;</h2><p>Wyatt was born in Brooksville, Florida, on May 23, 1987, to his parents, Mike and Stephanie Rotunda. Not much is known about Stephanie since she has kept herself out of the limelight.</p><p>However, her family is pretty well known because of her father and siblings. She is the daughter of wrestler Blackjack Mulligan and the sister of wrestlers Barry and Kendall.</p><p>Stephanie married Mike in 1984 and raised their three children as a devoted wife and mother.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She grew up in a wrestling family and was introduced to the sport from a young age. She did not wrestle personally, although she did appear on WWE television as Mike’s wife or Wyatt’s mother on occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, she always supported her husband and children with their career in wrestling. Talking about her husband, Mike, is an iconic figure in the wrestling world.</p><p>Mike retired from regular professional wrestling in 2003, although he still has infrequent matches and makes sporadic appearances. He and his wife founded a security firm in 2004 and have been operating it to date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barry Wyatt’s dad, Mike Rotunda’s career</h2><p>Mike was born in St. Petersburg, Florida on March 30, 1958. He attended Newark Valley High School and Owego Free Academy while he lettered in football and wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>He wrestled as an amateur, winning a sectional championship in the 215-pound weight class in 1976 and finishing fourth in the New York State Championships. Rotunda went to Syracuse University after finishing high school.&nbsp;</p><p>He played in football and amateur <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrestling</a>, winning the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association heavyweight title in 1981 and lettering in 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1981.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Mike was a successful amateur wrestler at Syracuse University who moved to Germany after graduation to pursue a career in professional wrestling. He made his debut in Quebec in 1981 before moving to Florida to work for Jim Crockett Promotions and Championship Wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>He rose to prominence after entering WWE in 1984, when he formed the U.S. Express tag team with Barry. They won the WWD Tag Team Championship for the first time in January 1985, earning them a match against the Iron Sheikh and Nikolai Volkoff at the first WrestleMania.&nbsp;</p><p>The Express were defeated at WrestleMania but reclaimed the championships a few months later to become two-time champions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bray-Wyatt.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Bray Wyatt with his dad and siblings. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Mike left WWE in 1986, eventually joining Jim Crockett’s NWA. He began as a midcard face before turning heel to join Kevin Sullivan’s Varsity Club, a group of amateur wrestlers dressed in collegiate singlets.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Death Steve Williams and Dan Spivey would subsequently join the group, as would the Steiner Brothers. Mike and Rick Steiner would dispute about who had the better alma mater early on, which evolved to them debating about who was the better wrestler.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike won the NWA World Television Championship in January 1988 and later feuded with and traded the championship with Rick Steiner when he left Varsity Club.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Mike momentarily departed NWA and returned with a new gimmick as Captain Mike Rotunda, a shipowner. He created his team with Abdullah the Butcher and Norman the Lunatic, who later became known as Bastion Booger, and they feuded with Rotunda’s old buddy Kevin Sullivan and ‘Sullivan’s Slaughterhouse.</p><p>That was short-lived, as Mike reverted to his old ways as Michael Wallstreet. Alexandra York, aka Terri Runnels, handled him, and he was a part of The York Foundation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The gimmick was that they claimed to know how to win each match and how long it would take Wall Street to win a match based on data analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 1991, Rotunda returned to WWE as Irwin R. Schyster, or IRS. His character was that of a heel tax collector who was always berating spectators and other wrestlers for not paying their due amount of taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>IRS made his PPV debut at SummerSlam 1991, defeating Greg Valentine, but he truly came into his own after teaming up with the Million Dollar Man, Ted DiDibiase, to create the Money Inc. combo. IRS and DiBiase had tremendous chemistry and were already doing similar things, so it was a natural fit.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When I started in WWF, there was no nXt. My developmental program was working with greats like Mike Rotunda. He took great care of me every night & I was a better pro wrestler because of him. I love that guy & my heart hurts so bad for him, his wife Stephanie, Taylor & Mika. ❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5N1ZPIBp0t</a></p>— Sean Waltman (@TheRealXPac) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 26, 2023</a></figure><p>Before DiBiase departed to become a commentator in 1993, they won three WWE Tag Team Championships.</p><p>IRS transitioned to singles competition and seemed to defeat Razor Ramon to win the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1994 following intervention from Shawn Michaels. Unfortunately, the referee restarted the match, and IRS was struck with a Razor’s Edge and lost.&nbsp;</p><p>DiBiase founded the Million Dollar Corporation in mid-1994, where IRS regularly collaborated with Bam Bam Bigelow. He had a solo feud with The Undertaker, including the IRS repossessing a child’s gravestone and taking Paul Bearer’s urn.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The first time Bray Wyatt (Windham Rotunda) and his brother Bo Dallas (Taylor Rotunda) met the Undertaker was backstage at an event where their father I.R.S (Mike Rotunda) was on.</p><p>Full post.👇 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sGjUPdz7Ay</a></p>— The Signature Spot (@SignatureSpot) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 25, 2023</a></figure><p>Finally, in 1995, he left Million Dollar Corporation. Mike then returned to WCW as V.K. Wallstreet in September 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked in the midcard for approximately a year before changing his identity to just Mr. Wallstreet. He was pushed out of the NWO in April 1997 after being granted a seat by DiBiase in December 1996.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike subsequently moved on to New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he was a member of NWO Japan for nearly two years until returning to WCW. At Starrcade 1999, he reformed the Varsity Club alongside Kevin Sullivan and Rick Steiner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rotunda departed WCW again in April 2000 and spent a few years with All Japan Pro Wrestling before retiring in 2003.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bray Wyatt’s siblings</h2><p>Wyatt has three <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">siblings</a> —&nbsp; a brother, Taylor, better known as Bo Dallas, and a sister, Mika Rotunda.</p><p>Following in his father’s footsteps, Bo Dallas began his wrestling career in 2008, after signing a developmental deal with WWE and being sent to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he made his debut under his own name.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Later, he changed his ring name to Bo Rotundo, then to Bo Rotunda, and finally to Bo Dallas. He won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice with his brother.&nbsp;</p><p>He has also won the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship three times. From 2010 to 2011, he had a brief appearance on WWE’s main roster as Husky Harris, a member of The Nexus faction led by Wade Barrett.&nbsp;</p><p>He later returned to WWE’s developmental area, now known as NXT, and won the NXT Championship in 2013. In 2014, he returned to the main roster with a new gimmick as an excessively optimistic motivational speaker who inspired people to “Bo-lieve” in themselves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He eventually established tag teams with other wrestlers, including The Social Outcasts, which included Heath Slater, Curtis Axel, and Adam Rose; The Miztourage, which included The Miz and Curtis Axel; and The B-Team, which included Curtis Axel.&nbsp;</p><p>He and Curtis Axel won the Raw Tag Team Championship once in 2018, defeating his brother Wyatt and Matt Hardy at Extreme Rules. Due to financial restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, WWE dismissed Bo Dallas and numerous other wrestlers in April 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, He hadn’t been seen on WWE TV since November 2019.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Bo Dallas claimed after leaving WWE that he had been investing in real estate for several years and had started a farm named Mama Farm with his partner, WWE wrestler Liv Morgan. He also said that he was writing a self-help book titled “The Art of Bo-Lieving.”</p><p>Unlike her siblings and father, Mika did not wrestle, but she did pursue a career in media and fitness. She graduated from the Connecticut School of Broadcasting in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>She then worked as a production assistant on many film and television productions, including Jannus Live, a Tampa Bay-based show where she shot and edited live performances. She also became an on-air radio personality for Cox Media Group, presenting 102.5 The Bone, one of Tampa Bay’s biggest radio stations.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She then worked as an assistant producer for Drew Garabo Live. Mika is also a fitness instructor and blogger who frequently shares exercise videos and motivating comments on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>She has worked on fitness initiatives alongside her brother Bo Dallas, including a YouTube series called Bo-Flex Challenge. Currently, Mika is a Tampa Bay Real Estate Realtor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570qmmq6yjZK%2BzrdhmrrKZpKl6p63ToZyrZaCWv6a606xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katy-perry-and-russell-brands-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Katy Perry and Russell Brand's Relationship Timeline</span></a>
