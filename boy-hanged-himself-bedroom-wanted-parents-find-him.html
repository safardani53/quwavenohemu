He'd rather have stayed at Brookfield. I don't think Adam agreed with the decision.”</p><p>Neighbours spoke of violent rows at the family’s home with Adam swearing at his parents and smashing things as they tried to get him into the car.</p><p>On one occasion he was seen being physically dragged into the vehicle.</p><p>Neighbours also reported the smell of cannabis coming from the semi-detached house in Walton, Chesterfield.</p><p>On the day he died Adam had run away from home barefooted, before returning to the house after his parents had gone to work.</p><p>His older brother Joseph returned home after school and spoke to his mum on the phone, who asked if Adam was home. He shouted out for him but got no reply, then left the house.</p><p>At 6pm his parents returned home to the sound of their dog barking. His dad went upstairs and made the terrible discovery.</p><p>He took him down and gave mouth-to-mouth as his wife dialled 999. Paramedics arrived and found signs of life, but despite their efforts, he was declared dead at Chesterfield Royal Hospital.</p><p>A post mortem found traces of cannabis in his system. The cause of death was compression to the neck.<br>A multi-agency review into Adam’s death found there were “no warning signs” that Adam was at “significant risk of harming himself”, the inquest was told.</p><p>Det Con Chapman added: "I don't think any agencies involved or any of the schools involved knew Adam would potentially hurt himself."</p><p>Adam's father Richard Bramley agreed saying: "My view is there was no indication Adam would do what he did."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Derbyshire’s Assistant Coroner Peter Nieto said he could not return a conclusion of suicide as he was unable to find that Adam intended to take his own life.</p><p>He said: “There were no suspicious circumstances and no indication that Adam was depressed, although there is evidence to support the fact he was a cannabis user.”</p><p>Given the timings and the fact Adam still showed signs of life when he was discovered, the coroner said was reasonable to conclude he had hung himself not long before, knowing they were due home.</p><p>Recording an open conclusion, the coroner said: “Adam was very upset by the temporary school move.</p><p>"He hadn't indicated to anyone that he was contemplating or likely to do what he did, it seems to me it was completely unexpected.</p><p>"There's the realistic and strong possibility that Adam didn't intend to take his own life. He may have intended his parents to find him, but not intended to kill himself."</p><p><strong>If you are having suicidal thoughts, suffering from anxiety or depression or just want to talk, call The Samaritans on 116 123.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbX54fpRxb2ian656qa3NoJydZZieurSxy59km52Up7ywuYywmKeslZl6sa3RnqWtq12btq%2BwjKGgpmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashleigh-veverkas-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Ashleigh Veverkas Boyfriend: Who is Ashleigh Veverka Dating?</span></a>
