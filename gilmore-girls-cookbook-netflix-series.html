With nudging from her boyfriend, she began whipping up a collection of recipes inspired by the show as a creative outlet. The self-proclaimed “Gilmore at heart” decided against making fellow fans wait for blog updates, opting to share them as a cookbook instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Ladies of London‘s Marissa Hermer to Release Her First Cookbook</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kristi Carlson/Kickstarter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carlson, who manages musicians by day, began a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kickstarter campaign</a> with a $20,000 goal to break even, but ultimately received $47, 273 in donations. “It was very exciting and also very stunning,” she says. “I think I've found the people, like me, who've been wanting to make these foods for a long time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Viral support of Carlson's cookbook also transformed it from an indie recreational activity into a book deal with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Skyhorse publishing</a>. After assuring Warner Brothers that the project is strictly a tool for fans to both geek and pig out with (the book is neither affiliated with the entertainment agency, nor the show)—it is finally scheduled for a December release.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Internet jokes ensued about Eat Like A Gilmore possibly being the unhealthiest cookbook ever thanks to Lorelai and Rory's no-regrets diet—Carlson assures the recipes are a practical take on their meals. “Real foods, using real ingredients. Foods that both sound and taste really good,” she wrote <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>on her blog</a>. As for the the argument about the Gilmore Girls themselves not being cooks? “It's not cook like a Gilmore, it's eat like a Gilmore,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meals like spicy macaroni and cheese with jalapeño chipotle cream sauce came from Carlson's memory of the best food moments on the show. Kickstarter backers helped blossom 60 recipes into over 100 eats—contributing ideas for more savory selections like apple tarts, Sookie's ratatouille and Luke's paella.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eat Like A Gilmore will also include recipes even the most dedicated fans may not recall— like squab (the meat of a young pigeon), the chicken chow mein sandwich and “The Rory”—a cocktail made for the character's 21st birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carlson, still knee-deep in book designs, isn't planning on eating any of the meals to celebrate the day her book finally hits stores. “I'm probably just going to order a pizza,” she laughs, in true Gilmore spirit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>WATCH: Melissa McCarthy Talks Her Return to the Gilmore Girls Revival Set</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But you don't have to follow in her footsteps, or wait until the end of 2016 to channel the Stars Hollow foodies.

Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.<br><strong>2.</strong> In a medium bowl, add the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt. Set aside.<br><strong>3.</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine butter, both sugars and molasses. Using a hand mixer, mix on a low and increase to a medium speed and mix until smooth.<br><strong>4. </strong>Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then dd eggs and vanilla and mix on medium until smooth.<br><strong>5. </strong>Add in dry ingredients from step 2, a third at a time, mixing in between, until all ingredients are fully combined. Dough will form and pull away from the sides of the bowl.<br><strong>6.</strong> Using 1 ½ inch scoop or tbsp. measure, scoop dough into 1 ½ inch balls.
