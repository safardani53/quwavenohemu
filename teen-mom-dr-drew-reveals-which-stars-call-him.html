She contacts me all the time. When she got Covid, she called me - it's a whole thing going on. Over the years, she's used me very effectively I think."</p><p>Dr. Drew continued: "So I've offered myself to everybody if I can be of help. A&nbsp;little bit <a href=#>Amber</a> over the years and a little&nbsp;bit <a href=#>Jenelle</a> [Evans]&nbsp;back then."</p><p>The addiction specialist explained why it's important for him to keep the conversations going with the cast given all the social media backlash they receive.</p><p>"And so,&nbsp;when I see some of the consternation online, 'Why don't you,' or 'Why does she,' it's like you're attacking somebody with serious medical things going on for which she is getting treatment. 'Shut up,' you know what I mean?" he continued.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"It's just really disturbing to me the way people feel at their liberty to attack people merely because they're on camera."</p><h2>SNAPPING BACK</h2><p>Dr. Drew said that the&nbsp;moms "work hard" to get to the point where they are today, and gave Leah as a "good example" of someone who made a <a href=#>positive transition</a> over the years.</p><p>"Remember where Leah was eight years ago, right? She was strung out, and I was helping her then, and she did an exceptional job of getting care and taking care of things and the dividends are right there in front of you," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>"And when she was out of it, people were just trying to destroy her. It's unthinkable, it's unconscionable to me that people feel at their liberty to attack someone in their weakest moments."</p><p>He added: "I know this has been&nbsp;quite an&nbsp;interesting 12 years with everybody, but some of these women are becoming really substantial people and&nbsp;Leah&nbsp;is one of them, and you can see it reflected in her kids."</p><p>The cast from Teen Mom: The Next Chapter - all <a href=#>except for Leah</a> - is gearing up for a return on Teen Mom Family Reunion season 2, which premieres on January 3rd.</p><p>Amber, <a href=#>Ashley Jones</a>, <a href=#>Briana DeJesus</a>, Catelynn, <a href=#>Cheyenne Floyd</a>, <a href=#>Jade Cline</a>, Leah, and <a href=#>Maci Bookout</a> will be joined by <a href=#>Kayla Sessler</a>, <a href=#>Kiaya Elliott</a>, and the cast's mothers.&nbsp;</p><h2>MAKING A COMEBACK?</h2><p>Although MTV viewers have been saddened to see some of the OGs not returning these last few years, including Jenelle, <a href=#>Chelsea Houska</a>, and Farrah Abraham, Dr. Drew weighed in on whether any would be making a comeback.</p><p>"I would like to see any or all of them back, including Farrah," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>"I told Farrah I would miss her when she left and I did miss her. I had a long relationship with all of these women through some intense experiences. I connected to them and I would be delighted to see them back if that's what they want to do. It's up to them."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Sophia Abraham's mom made a brief appearance on Family Reunion earlier this year and then went on social media stating she was breaking ties with the show due to what she claimed to be a <a href=#>"disturbing environment."</a></p><p>Until there's another reunion, catch more of Dr. Drew as he competes against 15 other celebrities in an <a href=#>"extreme experience"</a> in the new reality show <a href=#>Special Forces</a>, premiering on FOX on Wednesday, January 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/teen-mom-host-dr-drew-786314203.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/teen-mom-host-dr-drew-786314777.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/drew-lets-loose-teen-mom-657284603.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYGmCeoGUaKuenZ5iurC5jJ2pZpyimsRuvsSvnJqko2LEqbXCoWSsrJGnwG6vwKWjZqCZonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khloe-kardashian-flaunts-new-face-declared-unrecognizable-by-fan.html><span>←</span><span>Khloe Kardashian Flaunts New Face, Declared UNRECOGNIZABLE by Fans</span></a>
