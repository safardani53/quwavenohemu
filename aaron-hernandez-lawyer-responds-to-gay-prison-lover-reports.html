and convicted murderer <a href=#>Aaron Hernandez was found dead</a> in his cell at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts.</p><p>He was just 27 years old.</p><p>As more details emerge about the tragic life and death of Aaron Hernandez, the mystery of his decision to take his own life only deepens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/aaron-hernandez-in-cuffs-700x1024.jpg><p>Early in the investigation it was revealed that <a href=#>Hernandez had scrawled a Bible passage</a> on his forehead in blood.</p><p>Authorities later corrected that report, clarifying that what was thought to be blood was actually red ink.</p><p>That same ink was also used to create the appearance of stigmata-like wounds on Hernandez’s hands and feet.</p><p>Blood was reportedly used to create an unfinished pyramid drawing and write the word “Illuminati” in all-capital letters on the wall of Hernandez’s cell.</p><p>Adding to the mystery is the fact that <a href=#>Hernandez was acquitted on double murder charges</a> just days before his suicide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/aaron-hernandez-as-a-patriot.jpg><p>The former NFL star was still serving a life sentence for the murder of Odin Lloyd, but the acquittal improved his odds that he would be able to successfully appeal that conviction, which he was attempting to do.</p><p>Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the murder and maintained his innocence.</p><p>For obvious reasons, the public interest in Hernandez’s rise and fall, and his bizarre death, has been immense in recent days.</p><p>One of the most obsessed-over details is the fact that Hernandez left three suicide notes for authorities to find in his cell.</p><p>One was addressed to Hernandez’s daughter, another to the the girl’s mother, and a third to a fellow inmate who is believed to be <a href=#>Hernandez’s gay lover</a>.</p><p>The man has now been&nbsp;<a href=#>identified as Kyle Kennedy</a>, but&nbsp;he has reportedly&nbsp;declined to comment on the nature of his relationship with Hernandez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Now, Hernandez’s attorney, Jose Baez, is speaking out on his late client’s behalf and insisting that there is no truth to the rumors.</p><p>A romantic relationship between Hernandez and Kennedy, the lawyer states, simply did not occur, and reporting as much is irresponsible.</p><p>In a statement issued today, he claimed that there is no truth to the rumors that Hernandez was involved in a homosexual relationship:</p><p>“Rumors of letters to a gay lover, in or out of prison, are false,” says Baez.</p><p>“These are malicious leaks used to tarnish somebody who is dead.”</p><p>Baez did not say who the third letter was addressed to.</p><p>Asked by TMZ Sports if he still believes foul play may have been involved in Hernandez’s death, Baez replied:</p><p>“There is still plenty we are investigating.”</p><p>We’ll have further updates on this story as the case continues to unfold and more information becomes available.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier, a Newsweek report suggested a stunning new possible motive for the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013.</p><p>Years later the question of why Lloyd, a former semi-pro football player and friend of Hernandez, was killed remains largely unanswered.</p><p>Despite Hernandez’s conviction (there was ample evidence), prosecutors could never quite pinpoint a motive that completely made sense.</p><p>Which brings us to today …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/aaron-hernandez-on-the-field-874x1024.jpg><p>According to the magazine, Lloyd allegedly had knowledge of Hernandez’s closeted gay tendencies that he would kill to protect.</p><p>The&nbsp;Newsweek&nbsp;piece cites “interviews with multiple law enforcement officials directly involved in the case” who support this.</p><p>Those sources cite three pieces of evidence, most notably that Lloyd knew about the football star’s secret bisexual lifestyle.</p><p>Says one insider quoted by the magazine:</p><p>“Hernandez had a complicated sex life and [Lloyd] could pass that information to his girlfriend, the sister of the Patriots player’s fiancée.”</p><p>Follow this link to read the shocking full account of how, allegedly,&nbsp;<a href=#>Hernandez committed the murder to hide his bisexuality</a>.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Aaron Hernandez Commits Suicide; The Internet
