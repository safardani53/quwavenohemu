Three days after, “the nation locked down.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The “custom designed” dress, which was made by luxe bridal designer Pronovias, was definitely on the conservative side for the star. From the off-the-shoulder neckline and gorgeous train embellished with buttons, the gown oozed elegance and sophistication.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lala-Kent-Reveals-Princess-Inspired-Dress-She-Never-Got-Wear-002.jpg><p class=p1>It even came along with a touching tribute to her late father, Kent Burningham. “Alex surprised me with ‘Dad’ written inside of a heart that was going to be on my veil,” Kent revealed.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The post quickly attracted the attention of fellow Bravo stars and alums. <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong> </a>quickly commented, “Fit for a freaking QUEEN,” while <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong> </a>dropped heart eyes emojis.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a> said: “Beautiful beautiful dress!!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Love the custom embroidery detail that was going to be on the veil. So meaningful and special. I’m sorry you had to go through cancelling your wedding. I can’t even imagine the stress you went through.” <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Fans also took the chance to point out that the gown was reminiscent of Princess Aurora. “This is giving off such Princess Aurora vibes,” a follower wrote. Another chimed in: “Looks like princess Aurora’s dress in white.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Kent, who confirmed via an Instagram Stories in June that she plans to tie the knot with Emmett in 2022, as reported by <a href=#>E! News</a>, also shared that she and her designers are “going to start from scratch” when it comes to designing her next dress.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Kent previously opened up about having to postpone her nuptials to The Knot in March, stating that her and Emmett “both shed a lot of tears about our wedding being postponed over and over again.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>That in mind, there is a silver lining. The pair’s daughter, Ocean, whom they welcomed in March, will be included in the ceremony. “She will get to be a part of her mom and dad getting married,” the Give Them Lala author said. “Although I’m sure she won’t remember it, it means so much to me that she will be there with us. The thought of that overwhelms me with so much excitement and joy. She is the result of two people in love. I know it’s cheesy. I’m a cheese ball these days.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Kent and Emmett first met in 2015. They went on to make their relationship public and get engaged in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Gura2MpJynrF2nsrexwKWqZpyimsC0edKhnGavn6q5pXnHmq2eZaekv69506hknJmemLKtscNmrp6clJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./domenic-sarno.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Domenic Sarno net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
