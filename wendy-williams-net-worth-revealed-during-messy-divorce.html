src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Wendy Williams put a lot of work into her career.</p><p>She studied journalism and communications at Boston’s Northeastern University, graduating with a degree in 1986.</p><p>Wendy then got her start in professional radio broadcasting on a Virgin Islands radio station called St. Coix’s WVIS.</p><p>Six months later, the New Jersey native relocated to New York, where she landed a job at&nbsp;WBLC.</p><p>There, Wendy created her own segment, The Wendy Williams Experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Her autobiographical radio segment was outrageously popular, at times bringing in as many as 12 million listeners.</p><p>At the time, she was mostly just discussing her personal life.</p><p>She was about 20 years into her broadcasting career when she branched out into print media with her book, Wendy’s Got Heat.</p><p>Since the success of that book, she has penned a number of others.</p><p>It was not until 2008 that Wendy made the leap from radio to television.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So what has all of that success brought her?</p><p>Multiple outlets, including Good Housekeeping, estimate Wendy’s net worth as totally about $40 million.</p><p>Wendy’s current salary is reported at about $10 million per year.</p><p>That is a sizable, eight-figure fortune.</p><p>And while her job at the moment seems to be mostly just sitting in a chair and gloating about the misfortunes of other famous people, she did a lot of work to get where she is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As we reported, Kevin Hunter is asking for alimony from Wendy.</p><p>Notably, he worked as a producer on her show until just a few weeks ago, and is expected to receive a settlement from the show now that he’s been canned.</p><p>But let’s be real — Wendy was the real breadwinner.</p><p>A court may very well decide that Kevin, despite his outrageous cheating, deserves some degree of alimony from the woman he betrayed.</p><p>That didn’t sit right with their young adult son — which led to a physical fight between father and son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Just over a week ago, <a href=#>Kevin Hunter allegedly attacked his son</a> in a parking lot while they were out shopping together.</p><p>According to reports, he is said to have put 19-year-old Kevin Hunter Jr into a headlock.</p><p>In order to free himself, Wendy’s son punched his father in the face — and was then arrested by police.</p><p>(In domestic violence situations when family have been fighting, it is often the policy to arrest whichever party appears to have done the most damage)</p><p>The reason for their fight that led to Kevin Hunter Jr’s heroic action was that he had confronted his dad about demanding alimony payments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kevin then accused his son of having been brainwashed by his mother.</p><p>For the record, a teenager doesn’t need to be under hypnosis in order to see the dynamic between his parents for what it is.</p><p>One party ruined his marriage by cheating but still wants to keep all of the benefits of being married to a successful entertainer.</p><p>Unless … has Wendy brainwashed&nbsp;us, too?</p><p>That would certainly explaining why we can’t help but side with her in this divorce.</p><p>Even before the dude allegedly assaulted his son in a parking lot, Kevin Hunter didn’t seem like he deserved Wendy’s fortune.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Kevin Hunter: Who is Wendy Williams’ Awful
