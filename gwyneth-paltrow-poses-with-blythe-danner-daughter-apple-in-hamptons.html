But I think having that communication and also really wanting the same things and being aligned and wanting our marriage to deepen and grow is very helpful.”</p><p class=p1>Gwyneth has <a href=#>the full support of her husband</a>, which especially came in handy after Apple left home for college.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It’s been a major transition. I didn’t know what to expect, but I knew it would be hard because Apple and I are so close and were together all the time,” the<i>&nbsp;Iron Man&nbsp;</i>star —<a href=#> told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;that October</a>. “But I had no idea. It was like the worst heartbreak I’ve ever [felt]. I&nbsp;felt like <a href=#>the love of my life broke up with me</a> for weeks. It was terrible.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “Now, I’m getting more used to it and it also helps to see her happy and well-adjusted. That makes a huge difference. And she just came home for October break, so that was good. I’ll see her for Thanksgiving.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagr6mjsrW0jKmYpayipMRuvM6snKxlp57BqXnBpbCtoJVisaK6zZ6pZpyRqrSpwMSrZJqooKGybrXNZp%2BapaCpvK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./francia-raisa-back-at-work-after-donating-kidney-to-selena-gomez-w503645.html><span>←</span><span>Francia Raisa Back at Work After Donating Kidney to Selena Gomez</span></a>
