He’s been off the road for a little while and they were treating him in a different way, and we thought it was getting better, but then some days ago it took a bad turn,” Mike said, holding back tears.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“This comes in a season when we were really seeing God in the miraculous and hearing stories of that all the time,” he added. “We’re praying for J-dawg, that’s what we call him; his name is Jason, which strangely enough, or purposefully enough, his name means ‘one who heals’.” This is truly heartbreaking!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>[jwplatform jQjq72YX]</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>But even through the pain, the band stood tall, saying that they have faith in his recovery.&nbsp;“It doesn’t mean God doesn’t love Jason because he’s going through this. Jesus said in this life we will have trouble and do not be afraid because He has overcome the world,” he continued. “And there is something about the stuff that we go through in this life and this season that once we step out of this season and into eternity, we no longer have that to respond to anymore. We respond to the garbage and the difficulty in this life in front of Jesus, so we can carry on to Heaven with us an offering to God that can never be made once we are in Heaven… There’s no pain in Heaven, so we want to learn how to respond well to that stuff in this life, so we go through it with Jesus. And I’m so proud of my brother because he’s doing that right now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>But even though the amputation most has definitely helped his current state, Mike hinted that he is not out of the woods just yet.&nbsp;“We didn’t see the breakthrough yet, and it’s rough and seems like defeat,” he the band’s frontman said.<br><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Despite this incredibly sad time that Jason and the band are going through, the group muscled up enough energy and courage to perform their single, “My Story during the Fan Awards, which they dedicated to Jason. “I told my dad before we came, ‘how can we sing ‘My Story’?’ And he said, ‘because his story is not done yet.’ We’re all in the middle of some kind of thing that God is working out in all of us, but I do know this – God is so good.” Wow, we hope that Jason pulls through!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, share your well wishes to Jason in the comments below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH13e5BpZpuhl2KxorDDsmSwnZGrsm62wKymp2Wnmq63sdFmmaismGKzprHTZpimqKWprrWxw2agp56VmMGqu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uk-weather-forecast-dutch-plume-malibu.html><span>←</span><span>UK weather forecast - Brits hit the beach as 'Dutch plume' makes UK hotter than MALIBU with 25C scor</span></a>
