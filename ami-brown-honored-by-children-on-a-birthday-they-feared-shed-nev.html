"It’s awesome to still have our mother around, quite frankly."</p><p>Rain chimes in, saying: "Amazing."</p><p>Rain then says "Happy birthday, mom!" and Bear echoes the sentiment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That’s all very sweet, but Rain also wrote up a message of her own.</p><p><span id=react-root>"Dear mommy," Rain writes. "Happy birthday to the greatest woman I know!!!"</span></p><p><span>We know that Rain is going to turn 16 in a few months, but ti’s sweet that she still calls her mother "mommy."</span></p><p><span>"You inspire me beyond compare," Rain continues. "If I turn out to be anything like you my life would have purpose."</span></p><p><span>"You listen to me even when I’m having an anxiety attack over the dumbest things," Rain says. "You comfort me just by being in the room."</span></p><p><span>We should note that <a href=#>Rain has spoken about her mental health</a> before, and also that anxiety attacks are like allergies — it seeming "dumb" doesn’t make it so.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p><span>"You mean absolutely the world to me," Rain’s sweet birthday tribute message to her mom continues.

"Sipping tea with the grandkids."</span></p><p><span>"Happy birthday mommy," Rain concludes. "</span>I love you more than the world."</p><p>Rain isn’t the only one who wanted to put her affection for her mom in writing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In addition to the video that we’ve included, Bear also wrote his own message.</p><p>"Today was my Moms birthday!!" he writes with his characteristic lack of chill. "I have no words to describe how I feel to still have my Mom!"</p><p>A lot of people use exclamation marks on social media to show that they are being friendly in tone. Bear just seems enthusiastic.</p><p>"She’s always been there for me! My whole life!" Bear writes. "And I’ve been trying my hardest to be there for her!"</p><p>"Thank you everybody!!" Bear says in a shout-out to fans. "All the fans and family’s!! All the production crews we’ve worked with!!

Bear writes.</p><p>That is a very on-brand sentiment for him.</p><p>But Bear makes sure to remind people that Ami’s birthday is, of course, all about Ami.</p><p>"Happy birthday to the strongest and best mother ever!!!"</p><p>Bear concludes: "I will never give up and I will never surrender!!"</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8ornIZpmrp6ejeqm7zaipnpxdl8Zur8eio52qlaN6sLqMmmSboaKptaWt2GaroZ2pYrOmrdGem2armJqxbrrEr2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-shipley-brother-jaxon-shipley-age-gap-and-family-tree.html><span>←</span><span>Age Gap And Family Tree</span></a>
