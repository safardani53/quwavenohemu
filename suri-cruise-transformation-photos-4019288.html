Suri is the only child of Katie and her ex-husband,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a>, and she turned 15 years old on April 18. Over the years, Suri has been photographed out and about quite a bit, and fans have taken notice at how much she’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>growing up</a> to look just like her famous mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Suri-Cruise-then-and-now-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ever since Suri was little, she has captivated fans of both Katie and Tom alike. As a toddler, Katie was ready to take her to sporting events and normal family outings like the below picture when the mother-daughter duo attended a Los Angeles Galaxy and Chelsea match during a World Series of Football exhibition soccer game at the Home Depot Center! Suri’s beautiful brown hair mimicked her mom’s, and it was almost like seeing what Katie may have looked like when she was a little girl!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Suri-Cruise-then-and-now-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, that bond with her famous parents has been quite steadfast. Suri has been photographed out and about with both Tom and Katie as she’s grown up! When she was no more than four-years-old, Suri was carried into Super Bowl XLIV at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens on February 7, 2010! Cradled in her dad’s arms, Suri looked so excited to be seeing the roaring crowds, raving fans, and all the bright lights the stadium had to offer! It was such a fun family moment. But after Katie’s 2012 divorce from Tom, Suri started spending a lot of time with her stunning mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Suri-Cruise-then-and-now-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>And letting her daughter grow up in NYC was anything but easy. “We were followed a lot when [Suri] was little. I just wanted her outside, so I would walk her around to find parks at, like, six in the morning when nobody would see us,” Katie shared in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 2020 interview</a>. “But there’s one video where I’m holding her — she was two at the time — and she starts waving at the cameras. She’s pretty special.” And now, Suri is taking NYC by storm!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>But there is so much more to see from Suri’s time growing up in the public eye!
