Jerry Springer loved getting the audience involved, an iconic part of what made the show what it was.</p><p>However, this audience member went too far with his comments and was told that he would get: “beaten like a woman” and “beaten like a man,” leading to cheers in the crowd.</p><p>Even the security guards couldn’t hold back their smiles for this one.</p><p>“I laughed probably harder than I should have,” wrote one fan via <a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p>“Lmaooooooooooo,” laughed another.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>One of the funniest episodes on Jerry Springer Show.

However, it wasn’t the voice that made this one so iconic, in fact, it was the ‘Batman-like “I hate you” voice.</p><p>Again, the security couldn’t hold back their laughter as the rage kept growing and growing. To be honest, we can’t exactly blame him.</p><p>Of course, Jerry came to stir the pot along with the crowds “You suck, you suck, you suck,” cheers.</p><p>This one failed to up in a physical fight, but still TV gold nonetheless.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rip Jerry Springer</p><p>My favorite clip!

Apparently, he was thirsty and all he needed was, you guessed it, water, leading to a good old-fashioned swilling, <a href=#>Geordie Shore</a> style.</p><p>Somehow, the fight led to a twerking contest, but that’s one of the reasons fans around the world loved Jerry so much. Expect the unexpected!</p><p>“This is the greatest fight…..you can’t look away….you must laugh,” said another.</p><p>“I love how they had a twerk battle and then right after, they started fighting again,” laughed one fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-can-do-jumping-jacks-for-you>“I can do jumping jacks for you”</h2><p>Nev Schulman, move over, the original <a href=#>Catfish</a> is in town. Although no physical fight here, these four characters could create their own reality show.</p><p>This guy was getting scammed so the catfish could buy <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>‘s lipsticks but turns out the victim’ had a girlfriend all along, so no remorse for him here. Thanks for the TV gold though.</p><p>“I’M DEFINITELY WITH THE CATFISHHHH SHE’S AN ICON SHE’S A LEGEND SHE’S GOT A POINT AND SHE IS THE MOMENT,” exclaimed one fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-are-you-mayweather-boo>“Who are you?” “Mayweather boo”</h2><p>Who can forget the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iconic</a>: “Who are you?” “Mayweather boo” line.</p><p>Antonia said she had a reputation for fighting in her neighborhood and it seems like she gained one for fighting on TV after the Cold Hearted Convicts episode.</p><p>Of course, the iconic cheers and chants came from the crowd while the women continued to go at each other.</p><p>All it took was the line: “I see why he cheats,” and the match was on. The real Mayweather would have gone through a few rounds with these two.</p><p>“I have a feeling the security wants them to fight but are trying to do their job at the same time,” wrote one fan.</p><p>Another joked: “The girl in the audience that caught the wig has me in tears.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-18.35.52-1024x431.png><p>Unfortunately, with thousands of episodes, we couldn’t fit them all in, or we’d be here for another 17 years.</p><p>Always remember, to take care of yourselves, and each other.</p><p>RIP Jerry Springer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>might start a fight today in honor of Jerry Springer</p>— MartinLuther Lean (@InLeanWeTrust) <a href=#>April 27, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOo5yrqqliwLG%2ByKeenqqjYq%2Bmv9NmnaKfmKnAbq3SZquvZaOdvLh5x6iqrWWUnrK0ecCgnJ1lZ24%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sydney-sweeney-engaged-jonathan-davino-euphoria-150k-ring-private.html><span>←</span><span>Sydney Sweeney ENGAGED to Jonathan Davino as Euphoria star flaunts '$150K' ring after keeping romanc</span></a>
