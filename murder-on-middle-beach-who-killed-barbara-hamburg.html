and, second, who may have killed her.</p><p>So… who did it?</p><p>We don’t know, of course, or else this individual would be in handcuffs.</p><p>But one obvious suspect is <strong>Jeffrey Hamburg</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jeffrey is Barbara’s ex-husband and someone who went through a difficult divorce from the victim.</p><p>He was due to appear in court — opposite Barbara — on the day she was killed in order to sort out the issue of hundreds of thousands of dollars he allegedly owed her and their two kids.</p><p>Jeffrey was eventually arrested for failing to make these payments in 2012 — and, as of 2018, he was still fighting in the courts to avoid paying.</p><p>Might he have killed his ex to avoid shelling out all this money?</p><p>Of note:&nbsp;DNA found at the scene of the crime also did not match his own;
