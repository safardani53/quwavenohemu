This gave rise to his alter ego, Father Abraham (Vader Abraham, in Dutch). His duet with Wilma Landkroon, Zou het erg zijn, lieve opa (Would it be horrible, sweet grandfather?) charted at number one in the Netherlands. In 1975, he recorded his second greatest hit, The Little Café by the Harbor.</p><p>In May 1977, Kartner was invited to write a promotional song for The Smurfs, which resulted in the production of the single The Smurf Song. Pierre recorded the track with the dancing outfit Dynamite in 2005. Pierre recorded a duet, den Uyl is in the oil, with politician Hendrik Koekoek in reaction to the 1973 oil crisis. During the 1975 carnival season, he authored What do we do with the Arabs here?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pierre-Kartner-2.jpg alt="Pierre Kartner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2002, he collaborated with Pim Fortuyn on Wimmetje gaat, Pimmetje komt (Wim goes, Pim arrives).
