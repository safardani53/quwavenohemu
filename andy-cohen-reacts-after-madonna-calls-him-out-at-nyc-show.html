Also — go see the new tour. It blew me away!! What a great night. Can’t wait to go back. #TroublemakingQueen.”</p><p>Madonna, 65, noticed Cohen in the crowd during her Celebration Tour stop in Brooklyn on Saturday, December 16. She pointed at the <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a> With Andy Cohen host in the front row and <a href=#>called him out</a>.</p><p>“If you say one more bad thing about me on your show, you’re gonna get in so much trouble,” Madonna joked on stage. “You little troublemaking queen!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andy-Cohen-Reacts-to-Madonna-Calling-Him-a-Troublemaking-Queen-on-Stage.jpg><p>In the clip, Cohen could be seen screaming, “I love you,” back at Madonna. “Yeah, sure. It’s that crazy kind of love. I know about it. I’m addicted to it myself,” she responded.</p><p>When sharing a video of the interaction on Sunday, Cohen also posted various moments from WWHL when he gushed over the singer by awarding Madonna with his “Mazel of the Day.”</p><p>“You just keep getting better and better,” Cohen said during one throwback moment. In a second, he praised Madonna for having “80,000 people dancing for two hours.”</p><p>Cohen even shared a clip from a 2013 WWHL episode where he and <strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong> went head-to-head in Madonna trivia, moderated by <strong>Wendi McLendon-Covey</strong>.</p><p>While the Bravo host is a huge fan of the musician, Cohen shared a not-so-nice text message he received from Madonna earlier this year.</p><p>“Madonna still has not done the show. I hope she does,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Cohen revealed</a> on “The Howard Stern Show” in June. “I’m actually kind of over it because in my Notes app, I was keeping a long list of interview questions for her in case she ever did the show, and she’s kind of answered a lot of it.”</p><p>Cohen went on to say that he and Madonna had been in contact “a couple years ago” when he and friend <strong>Anderson Cooper</strong> went to see one of her concerts.</p><p>“She said to me ‘Stop having people trash me on your show,’” he recalled. “I said, ‘I speak so positively — on the radio and Watch What Happens Live. Only the bad stuff gets picked up.’ I can make a four-hour montage of me licking Madonna’s ass on Watch What Happens Live or on the radio.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cohen explained that he plays a Madonna song “every 75 minutes” on his “Andy Cohen’s Kiki Lounge” radio station.</p><p>“That’s how many Madonna songs there are in the queue,” he added. “So, that’s how big of a fan I am.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappSueqS7x56lZqqVlrC1v4yana2domK6orDOp6WaZZOWua2%2FjKGgpmWfqsFurdNmpbKbXai1sMOO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-rahul-roy-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Rahul Roy Dating Now</span></a>
