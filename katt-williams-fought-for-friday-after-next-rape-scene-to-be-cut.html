He explained to Sharp what he told the filmmakers at the time,“If you would allow me, allow us to do this movie without a Black man getting raped in it, I promise you it will be twice as funny.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Katt-Williams-Fought-For-Friday-After-Next-Rape-Scene-to-Be-Cut-2.jpg><p>Williams told this story about Friday After Next in response to remarks that comedian <strong>Rickey Smiley</strong> made on the podcast “<a href=# rel=noopener>Pierre’s Panic Room</a>” in 2022 about the film. At the time, Smiley, 55, said that Williams was originally supposed to be Santa Claus, the robber, in the film until Ice Cube decided to swap his and Williams’s roles.</p><p>As Williams tells it, the role of Money Mike was always his. “[Smiley] told everybody it should have been my role, everybody on the scene.” Williams shared with Sharp, “So considering that’s the real story, why would you bring up that story? 35 members of the cast have never brought up that Rickey Smiley was going to play Money Mike.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Williams has gone on to become a well-known comedian with eight stand up specials and many roles under his belt in television, including roles in Atlanta and Black-ish, and films like Norbit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarKRixKq4y6KYpqtdm7y2s8etZJ%2BnomKzs7XDmrBmmZapsrN5zZ6vrWWilr2medKcnKedXam8bq7EZpqurF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pilar-pilapil.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Pilar Pilapil net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
