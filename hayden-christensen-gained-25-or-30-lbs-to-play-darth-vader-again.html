I <a href=#>just consumed as many calories</a> as possible. I put on 25 or 30 pounds to fill out that suit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Hayden-Christensen-Gained-25-Lbs-Play-Darth-Vader-Again-Obi-Wan-002.jpg><p class=p1>Christensen reprised his&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>franchise role as Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader in the Disney+ miniseries opposite <a href=#><strong>Ewan McGregor</strong></a>’s Obi-Wan. Before filming the series, which began airing in May, the Canada native <a href=#>had about nine months to work on his Darth Vader body</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I <a href=#>try to avoid the dad bod thing</a>,” Christensen jokingly told the magazine, noting he has not retained his&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>physique since filming wrapped. “And I was trying to maintain that Vader body after we finished. But, honestly, I pretty much just went back to my old diet. I kind of&nbsp;deflated&nbsp;after that.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Little Italy&nbsp;</i>actor got his big break<a href=#> playing Anakin Skywalker in the franchise’s prequel trilogy</a>, which included 2002’<i>s&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&nbsp;</i>and 2005’s&nbsp;<i>Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith</i>. In the films, Anakin is revealed to be the notorious intergalactic villain Darth Vader.</p><p class=p1>“I was in high school, like, a year before [I got cast as Anakin] doing school plays. I was living in Vancouver at the time, and<a href=#> it was a long audition process</a>,” Christensen recalled during a June appearance on&nbsp;<i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.&nbsp;</i>“I got the call [that I booked the role and] I was shocked and in disbelief. … It’s an honor to get to wear [the costume] but definitely the best part is seeing people’s reactions when they see Vader.”</p><p class=p1>After wrapping his trilogy appearance, the&nbsp;<i>Jumper&nbsp;</i>actor eventually returned to his&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i></a>roots when he joined the Disney+ miniseries.&nbsp;<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>, which aired its season finale earlier this month, follows McGregor’s character as he oversees a young Luke while living on the planet Tatooine. Christensen, for his part, has embraced the full evil nature of Vader in the new series.</p><p class=p1>“It’s a good four to five hours getting all of the prosthetics put on, and I got to work with <a href=#>a great team of makeup artists</a>, led by a fellow called <strong>Shaun Smith</strong>, and they did some incredible work,” he told <a href=#>Collider</a> of getting back into character during a June interview. “It was a lot of time sitting, staying very still while they glue layers of prosthetics all over your body. But I really enjoy just the visual creation that took place every time. It so much affects the way that you feel and you behave when you see yourself like that. So I enjoyed it.”</p><p class=p1>Before filming began, the&nbsp;<i>American Heist&nbsp;</i>actor also needed to relearn how to <a href=#>excel with a lightsaber</a> — and his 7-year-old daughter, <a href=#>Briar Rose</a>, was an integral part.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We have a couple lightsabers kicking around the house. She was my first lightsaber training partner when I came back to the&nbsp;<i>Obi-Wan</i>&nbsp;show,” Christensen <a href=#>told <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> during his June 24 appearance</a> of his little girl, whom he shares with ex <a href=#><strong>Rachel Bilson</strong></a>. “She knows Daddy’s Darth Vader, [but] <a href=#>she’s&nbsp;never seen Daddy as Darth Vader</a>. … I&nbsp;might show her the prequels soon, but still, there’s some scenes we might have to fast forward through.”</p><p class=p1><i>Obi-Wan Kenobi&nbsp;</i>is currently streaming on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahmamZsq95wqGpoqukmru0sc1mnpqhnpqxbn6UZqarZWNleq2u0marqGWgoa66ecOaqa2gXauupbHRZpigmZmjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lance-laury.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Lance Laury net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
