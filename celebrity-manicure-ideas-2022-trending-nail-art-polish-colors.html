Take a page out of <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>’s playbook and go with an appropriately on-theme oval set. The Good American founder put a modern twist on a traditional French manicure, opting for pastel pink tips. She even added an extra something-something: three heart stickers!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>KoKo isn’t the only Kardashian stepping up her nail art game in recent weeks. <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> took chrome nails for a test run — and basically broke the internet in the process.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 42-year-old Poosh founder made a point to match her silver nails to the bling on fiancé <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>’s grill, which was whipped up by dentist Thomas Connelly. A picture of the mani and the mouthpiece side by side was shared to the 46-year-old drummer’s Instagram page and naturally, fans had a lot to say.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While the Kardashian family is hands-down influencing what’s trending in the nail art space, we’d be remiss not to touch on the impact of Euphoria. While season one was all about hair and makeup, season two has shined a light on all things nails.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And the actress’ love nail art IRL just as much as their on screen characters. Take <strong>Alexa Demie</strong> for example. The actress, who plays Maddie Perez in the show, worked with nail artist Natalie Minerva for a “caged” design that featured strategically placed gemstones.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While she went a little grunge, costar <a href=#><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong></a> channeled her inner flower child with her latest look. The YSL ambassador debuted a floral design via Instagram thanks to nail artist Zola Ganzorigt. The design is pretty easy to DIY too — just grab a handful of shades and order a dotting tool!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>From <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>’s elevated French design to <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a>’s take on Euphoria glam, keep scrolling to see the best nail designs of 2022!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvCnqOemqKewbp5zJqlopulp7JutcOemKxlYmV%2Fc3nTq5ynnJmjtG66wKKjZpmiqXqxu8uiqqFlk6S5sL7SaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./21-most-booty-ful-belfies-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>21 Most BOOTY-ful Belfies of All-Time</span></a>
