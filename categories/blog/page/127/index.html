FANS were telling Scott Carson to “go to sleep” after a hilariously bizarre 6am tweet following Manchester City’s Treble parade party.
City’s stars went from Istanbul to Manchester to Ibiza and back to Manchester in the space of 48 hours since Pep Guardiola's men beat Inter Milan to win the Champions League.
They then took to the streets of the city last night for a bus parade in front of thousands of supporters to show off the trophy alongside their Premier League and FA Cup crowns.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Web users shocked after Norwich tourism site accidentally redirects them to hardcore porn site T</h2><time>Mar 22, 2024</time>

A TOURISM webpage to promote Norwich directed visitors to a hardcore porn site.
Taxpayer-funded visitnorwich.co.uk mistakenly linked its blog on pancakes to a kinky sex advice site.
Visitors wanting to browse menus from mobile caterer Christophe’s Crepes were instead sent to Christophe’s, a website with graphic images of sex and threesomes.
It offers advice on spicing up sex lives and appears to be aimed at men.
One diner was shocked by the link as he sought somewhere to eat in the Norfolk city — home of East Anglian TV comedy character Alan Partridge.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Chris Robinson Dating Now</h2><time>Mar 22, 2024</time>
