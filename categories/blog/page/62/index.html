We never thought we’d say this.
It seemed absolutely impossibly.
But it now must be uttered because it really may be the case:

Producers control who moves on According to&nbsp;TheThings.com, the producers of&nbsp;AGT&nbsp;have complete control over the acts that go place on stage.
The judges’ votes are supposed to count for a contender, however, a Redditor verifies that they don’t.
The people candidates need to impress are the producers in order to continue on the program.
Fans were shocked by golden buzzer snub The season premiere was&nbsp;received with backlash by fans after 11-year-old contestant D'Corey Johnson received a standing ovation from the judges and audience for his rendition of Journey's Open Arms - but didn't get a golden buzzer from the judges, which allows an act to go straight to the live shows without having to audition again.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Asia Nitollano Officially Snubs Pussycat Dolls</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>

CW head Dawn Ostroff says Asia quit to pursue a solo career. This might explain why Nitollano was a no-show for the Dolls’ performance at the big Live Earth concert earlier this month.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ciara, Russell Wilson Have 'First Date Night' After Welcoming Baby Amora</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>
