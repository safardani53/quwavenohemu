It’s none of my business.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Whatever that means! John’s definitely being coy, and his lack of a denial sure seems closer to a confirmation that Taylor was his songwriting target.</p><h3>John Mayer’s ‘Paper Doll’ Lyrics Lead To Speculation</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>After Taylor’s “Dear John” left him “humiliated,” as he told&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;in 2012, he may have fired back with his own song! The chorus seemingly makes reference to her song, “22”: “You’re like 22 girls in one / And none of them know what they’re running from / Was it just too far to fall for a little paper doll?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He also sings a lyric in “Paper Doll” that says, “Someone’s gonna paint you another sky,” which matches her “Dear John” lyrics, “You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The references are subtle, but definitely questionable, and John’s answer to the burning question on&nbsp;Today didn’t convince us at all that the song isn’t about Taylor!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>What do YOU think of John’s answer, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Did he confirm or deny that his song is about Taylor?</p><h3>WATCH:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Taylor Swift Dissed By John Mayer In ‘Paper Doll’</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><br><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>—&nbsp;Taylor Weatherby</strong></p><h3>More News About John Mayer & Taylor Swift’s Disses:</h3><li>John Mayer Disses Taylor Swift In New Song ‘Paper Doll’ — Watch</li><li>Taylor Swift Disses John Mayer With AMA Performance?</li><li>Taylor Swift’s Emotional Reaction To John Mayer’s Insults</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH14e49vZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2fvKm6jKaYsp2iYrGqv9Jmqqiml2K9orzEq2Sdp5yherPBzKiprGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gina-krasley-my-600-lb-life-star-dead-at-30.html><span>←</span><span>Gina Krasley, My 600-Lb Life Star, Dead at 30</span></a>
