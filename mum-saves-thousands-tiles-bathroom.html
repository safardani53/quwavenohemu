It has a really relaxing and cozy feel to it that gives you a lovely sense of escapism!”</p><p>Most of Julie’s supplies came from budget stores such as B&Q, IKEA, B&M and Matalan.&nbsp;</p><p>“My first stop was B&Q, where I picked up Dulux Rich Black for £17 and White Satin V33 Wall Tile and Panelling Paint for £25.&nbsp;</p><p>“I also needed to think about the bath, which had a lot of black mould. To tackle this, I used Unibond Re-New Sealant off Amazon for £5 to cover it all up. Another area which needed work was the floor tiles, so I used a Black Grout Pen off Amazon which cost £3.99.</p><p>“The next job was finding an under-sink console that wasn’t too big, as I only have a small space between the sink and the bath.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“I eventually found one that fit perfectly for £34.99 from The Range, and I painted the handles black to match the colour theme.</p><p>“I revamped my tired looking bath panel by using self-adhesive wall tiles.&nbsp;</p><p>“They cost £1 a sheet from One Below and it cost me £15 altogether. I got some self-adhesive wall caddies off Amazon for £15.</p><p>“I was able to save money on the decorations as I do a bit of graphic design in my spare time and have an Etsy shop selling art prints and wedding stationery.&nbsp;</p><p>“Therefore I made some of my own prints and enjoyed creating simple designs to add to the Scandinavian picture wall.&nbsp;</p><p>“I used artificial plants and accessories from IKEA, B&M, Tesco, Dunelm and Matalan to give a natural look to the room and add some colour. Altogether these didn’t cost more than £15.</p><p>We’ve saved thousands by decorating ourselves and it now looks like we have got a new bathroom!</p><span class=quote-credit>Julie Pentelow</span><p>“I cleaned up my dirty shower screen after seeing a hack on YouTube. They use a razor blade in the original video with some white vinegar – I used a paint scraper, white vinegar, Viakal spray and Elbow Grease spray and it made it look like a new shower screen!</p><p>“The self-adhesive tiles were pretty easy to put on the bath panel. I cut them to size with scissors and also used self-adhesive spray from B&M for extra adhesion! I painted the tiles using a mini foam roller, it went on really smoothly and made them look like new.</p><p>“Having 2 young children often made it difficult to find time to work on the project without them being near the wet paint or distracting me.&nbsp;</p><p>“My husband Mike helped keep them out of the way at times, and I also did a lot of the work on my day off during the week when my youngest was napping.</p><p>“When it came to painting walls, I often only had time to paint one wall before then going back to mummy duties and the school run, so a lot of the time we had a partially painted room for a few days or weeks until I could get a chance to do the next bit!&nbsp;</p><p>“At least some of it was done in lockdown when we couldn’t have people around so I could get it finished before other people would see it.</p><p>“If I had to do this project again, I would have allowed more time. It was a bit of a rush job and some of the tiles could have been painted better, the paint instructions mention waiting certain periods of time before a recoat and before showering, I admit I probably didn’t wait as long as it said to.</p><p>“We’ve saved thousands by decorating ourselves and it now looks like we have got a new bathroom!”</p><p>Tom Church, Co-Founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, said: “Julie has done a great job transforming her bathroom - the Scandinavian style is becoming more popular these days due to its clean, minimalist design.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“She has undoubtedly saved a lot of money by painting the walls herself - according to Household Quotes, the average painting and decorating prices are around £160 a day, with prices between £375 and £500 to paint an average sized room.&nbsp;</p><p>“Plus, creating a new tile bath panel can cost £300 on average according to Building Sheriff. Furthermore, prints can easily cost £20-50 each depending on size, so Julie has done well to create her own.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000678529819.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>DIY fanatic shares easy way she transformed her old kitchen side into ‘marble’ and it saved her thousands</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BvZ3JvYGh%2BcLnUpmSsmaaawG7Ax6isrJmemcBuwMilnKxlkpbBqb7OqKRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lamar-odom-rap-video.html><span>←</span><span>Lamar Odom Crack Video - The Hollywood Gossip</span></a>
