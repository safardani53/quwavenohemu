Or like a doll of one of her sisters.</p><p>Now, fans are roasting her for editing a photoshoot so that she looks just like Kourtney.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Khloe Kardashian posted a set of six photos this week, all of which are included in this article.</p><p>In two of the images, she stands, posing very deliberately to accentuate her booty — not that she needs much help.</p><p>In four of the photos, she sits in different positions on an outdoor marble countertop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>What is striking about these pics isn’t just that Khloe looks great … but how she looks.</p><p>She looks straight-up different. Not like herself.</p><p>Whether it is the angle of photographs, the makeup, or editing, she has larger eyes, higher cheekbones, and a more slender nose than she does in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I thought this was Kourtney at first glance," comments one fan.</p><p>Another even more bluntly wrote: "You’ve completely changed."</p><p>"You look totally different," anothe rcommenter observed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"I didn’t recognise her," another fan’s comment reads.</p><p>"What did you do to your face??" another demanded to know. "You look so different."</p><p>Clearly, this was not a case of one person’s opinion. Virtually everyone found Khloe’s photos to look startlingly different from the Khloe they know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Khloe did actually respond to that first commenter, the one who told her that they thought that it was Kourtney at first.</p><p>"Wow!! What a compliment," Khloe wrote.</p><p>While Kourtney is undoubtedly the prettiest of the first batch of Kardashians, we think that Khloe was trying to deliberately spin the comment as a compliment rather than as an accusation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Notably, Khloe was accused of face-editing shenanigans back in May.</p><p>In fact, it has been reported that Khloe’s social media shapeshifting has spawned discussions about whether celebrities should be required to admit to editing their pics.</p><p>You know how they are required to acknowledge when they’re doing a paid ad? Well, some laws may require them to tell their followers when they’ve tweaked their own looks, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"Why do you look so different in all your photos?" one fan recently asked Khloe.</p><p>Khloe clapped back at the time: "My weekly face transplant clearly." To be clear, that reply was dripping in sarcasm.</p><p>Remember, we live in a world where some people genuinely believe that celebrities are cloned, mind-controlled, and/or engaging in a drug-fueled devil worship centered upon child predation. Some people will believe anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Reports say that Khloe does not give a single flying flip about the backlash that her facetuned-within-an-inch-of-their-lives photos are receiving.</p><p>If this insight is to be believed, she’s content so long as she is having fun and happy.</p><p>She would prefer to have photos that she personally feels happy with than to have her fans feel that the pics are authentic. That’s fair … but possibly a little sad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This brings us to Khloe’s longtime struggle with her self-image, a struggle that fueled her dramatic "revenge body" transformation several years ago.</p><p>While we wouldn’t call the way that fans refer to millionaire celebrities "bullying," there was certainly a lot of cruelty and pressure thrust upon Khloe by the general public.</p><p>Body-shaming is never okay, and many fans believe that it continues to drive Khloe to distort her appearance in photographs. That is heartbreaking.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Caitlyn Jenner Turns 70… Gets Snubbed by Khloe?!?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WGcLfHpaaeZZuWv6Wt0qGgmqZdp7yiv9Oem2aen6d6p63CnquuppmjtG68yJyqZqyfYrmwu8pmoa6rpGK5qrfEZqJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6-cbs-sync-facts-from-hashtag-s10-e7.html><span>←</span><span>6 CBS Sync Facts From &amp;quot;Hashtag&amp;quot; S10 E7</span></a>
