This isn't typically the case, but it seems the streaming service is undergoing a temporary error that should likely be fixed shortly.</p><p>Those attempting to watch Season 3 are airing their frustrations on social media, in the hopes of connecting with others dealing with the same issue.</p><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor</a> started a thread in the Peacock subreddit, noting, "There is no audio option for English when trying to watch Yellowstone Season 3."
