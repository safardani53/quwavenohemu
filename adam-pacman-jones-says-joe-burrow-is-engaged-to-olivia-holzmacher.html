Jones, however, admitted that he didn’t know any specifics about Burrow’s romance with his college sweetheart.</p><p>“If he [proposed] in the middle of training camp, this guy is able to handle a lot of different things,” McAfee, 36, noted, while cohost <strong>Boston Connor</strong> added, “Good calf, too, if he can get down on one knee.” (Burrow was carted off the football field in July after <a href=#>straining his calf</a> during a practice drill and <a href=#>hasn’t practiced or played</a> in any games since.)</p><p>Neither Burrow nor Holzmacher have announced or confirmed the news of their reported engagement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Retired-NFL-Player-Adam-Jones-Claims-Joe-Burrow-Is-Engaged-to-Girlfriend-Olivia-Holzmacher-03.jpg><p>The pair began dating in 2017, two years after they met while attending Ohio State University. After graduating in three years, Burrow subsequently enrolled at Louisiana State University to become the Fighting Tigers’ quarterback after not receiving enough playing time during his time with the Buckeyes. He went on to <a href=#>win a National Championship</a> with LSU in January 2020 and was drafted by the Bengals several months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Retired-NFL-Player-Adam-Jones-Claims-Joe-Burrow-Is-Engaged-to-Girlfriend-Olivia-Holzmacher-01.jpg><p>Throughout Burrow’s football journey, Holzmacher has supported him in all of his endeavors.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Tonight a new chapter starts for you! Thankful to be by your side Joe and to be a part of the past three seasons,” Holzmacher wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in April 2020 alongside a photo of Burrow on stage at the NFL draft. “I’ve had the best experiences and met the best people along the way. So excited for what the future holds. Tonight will be once in a lifetime night for you.”</p><p>When the Bengals made it to Super Bowl LVI against the Los Angeles Rams in 2022, Holzmacher — and Burrow’s mom — cheered on the quarterback at SoFi stadium. Despite the loss, Holzmacher gushed about how far Burrow has come. “Still beyond proud,” she wrote via her Instagram Story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanJGierGtwqaYp2WapLumv4ysmLKrXZ%2B8pnnBrqmrp6ditrR5xKeemp%2BVmXq1u4yoo6KumZZ6qbvLs6Sam5iav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-max-ehrich-demi-lovato-soap-actor-3979563.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Max Ehrich? 5 Facts About Demi Lovatos Fianc Hollywood Life</span></a>
