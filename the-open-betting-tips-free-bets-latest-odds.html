And the stuff that went before that was almost as impressive!</p><p>At 9-1, Scheffler is finally at a price that makes him each way value. So he has to be the headline bet at Hoylake. But there are plenty more tempting options among the supporting cast, too.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Get £30 in Free Bets with bet365 Bonus Code</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Sign up with with our exclusive promo code: SUN365</p><h2>How to bet on the Open</h2><p>Betting on golf is easier than you'd image and there are a host of interesting markets you can pick from.</p><p>Here are five easy steps for beginners.</p><p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Choose Your Favourite Sportsbook</strong>&nbsp;– there are plenty to choose from and most have their own app or mobile site.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Make a Deposit</strong>&nbsp;– each sportsbook will walk you through how to connect your bank account to their system including providing a list of all the safeguards they have set up to ensure the safety of your transactions.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Claim Your Bonuses</strong>&nbsp;– most sportsbooks offers bonuses to first time bettors in the form of free bets.</p><p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Place Your Bet&nbsp;</strong>– now it’s time to navigate through your sportsbook’s odds where they will offer a variety of options including outright winners, or top finishing positions, such as top 10 or 20, or even to make the cut.

He has finished T4 and T20 in the last two Majors, and his from on the LIV circuit has been eye-catching too, especially a stunning 63 at Valderrama.</p><p>DeChambeau showed a liking for the links with a share of eight at St Andrews last year, so he looks more than capable of rewarding each way backers.</p><p><strong>Wyndham Clark </strong>did us a huge favour at the US Open, but there is no chance of him teeing off at 66-1 again for a while - although, surprisingly, you can get 50-1 if you shop around.</p><p>Clark is a golfer going places. He has already won twice this year, is up to tenth in the world rankings, and a tie for 25th in Scotland was decent enough preparation for this week.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">BetVictor sign up</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Sun-BETVICTOR-Reviewed-By-Us.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Bet £10 get £40</p><p>18+| Opt-in, bet £10+ at odds 2.00+ within 7 days.

No-one putts better on links courses than the Aussie, and it is hard to see him failing to contend.</p><p>One more thought on the LIV players. <strong>Talor Gooch</strong> has proved the most successful golfer on the breakaway circuit, winning three times, most recently at Valderrama last month, when paired with Koepka and DeChambeau.</p><p>If you can see off that pair and win at Europe’s toughest course, you can win anywhere. So odds of up to 80-1 are worth looking at.</p><p>And if you are looking to get a run for your money from players at even bigger prices, the enigmatic <strong>Keegan Bradley </strong>could be worth an interest at 125-1.</p><p><strong>Adrian Meronk </strong>and <strong>Alexander Bjork </strong>have been among Europe’s most consistent performers this year, and both are available at 200-1. They both have the added incentive of trying to push their Ryder Cup claims.</p><h2 id=remember-to-gamble-responsibly>Remember to gamble responsibly</h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to www.gamstop.co.uk to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jpucrayZo7RwfpJpb2lrYWp8tbTEZqapnZ5ir6bA06KloGWknr20ecWrnJ5lkprBtHnLmqueq6RivKWw0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-james-uncomfortable-rihanna-pictures-lebron-james-inappropriate-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Savannah James Uncomfortable With Rihannas Pictures Of LeBron On Instagram Hollywood Life</span></a>
