The show, hosted by Chris Hardwick, sees participants battle through a series of trivia questions in an attempt to score up to $12 million per episode. The rules of the game are simple. Competing teams answer a series of trivia questions. If a team answers correctly, a green ball will fall down the digital pegboard, landing on a dollar amount which is added to the group’s winning total.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout the episodes, the trivia questions become more complicated, and so does the gameplay. Team members are isolated from one another after Round 1, making for an even more complex guessing game. One player is left to determine which drop zone to place the balls. While the remaining player, who was kept in isolation, must then correctly answer each trivia question to score the perspective winnings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout its five-season run, The Wall has had its fair share of victorious players. In April, Christiana and Nic Trapani won over $1.3 million during their stint on the show. The husband and wife own Door County Candle Co., a candle company which donates a portion of its proceeds to Ukraine relief efforts, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Bay Press Gazette</a>. They were the ninth competitors to win over $1 million on the popular game show, which first premiered in 2016.</p><p>However, Christiana and Nic aren't the biggest winners in the show’s history, as that title goes to another lucky pair.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The most money won on 'The Wall' was close to $2 million!</h2><p>Contestants on The Wall can potentially win big. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>, participants can walk away with up to $12 million. However, the largest amount ever won was closer to $2 million. In Season 3, siblings Hector and Hetchan claimed the show’s record for the highest winnings ever in a single episode. The duo walked away with a whopping $1.7 million appearing on the game show in 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>“We were two kids of many siblings growing up in the Bronx, and you know it was bad,” Hetchan said to his brother, before revealing their win. “We had more bad days then good, we’ve seen rock bottom.” He later revealed that the pair won the record-breaking prize, as the two cried tears of joy. Prior to their win, the pair revealed that they wanted to win the prize money so they could assist relatives impacted by Hurricane Maria.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The New Jersey natives weren't the only lucky winners from the show. The second-biggest win in The Wall’s history also came in Season 3 thanks to a grandmother and granddaughter duo from Pennsylvania. Nellie “Memaw” Wallace and Taylor Boulden won a total of $1.6 million after discarding a contract worth $135,343. Rounding out the top three winners list is another pair from Season 3, Rebekah and Chris. The married couple from Orlando appeared in the Season 3 premiere and won $1.4 million.</p><p>The Wall airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfory0wIympqedqWLEsLqMqKVmrJiaerity6U%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prime-drink-ksi-logan-paul-warning-caffeine-fda.html><span>←</span><span>New Prime warning over potential 'dangers' of KSI and Logan Paul's energy drink</span></a>
