She was married to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Matt LeBlanc</a>, famously known as&nbsp;Joey Tribbiani from Friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on for an in-depth insight into her&nbsp;life with her former husband and children.&nbsp;</p><h2>Melissa McKnight&nbsp;Modeled From Young Age</h2><p>McKnight was born on March 10, 1965, in England — she moved to the United States at a young age. Thus, she&nbsp;is English by birth and an American by nationality.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The gorgeous blonde with blue eyes and perfect physique had everything it took to be a model.&nbsp;</p><p>After entering&nbsp;the field at a young age, she established herself as one of the top&nbsp;models of the 80s and 90s, where she appeared as the face of the biggest fashion magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Elle, Vogue, and many more.</p><p>The British-American model transitioned as an actress in the early millennium and appeared in a few feature films.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the former model's background, including details of her parents, siblings, and education, is off the media. That being said, it is known that her age is 57 as of this time of writing.</p><h2>Melissa McKnight&nbsp;Has Married Twice Including Matt LeBlanc</h2><p>McKnight was first&nbsp;married to filmmaker Anthony Esposito. From the marriage, she&nbsp;became the mom of two children — Tyler Esposito and Jacqueline Esposito.</p><p>Sadly, the marriage didn’t last, and the couple parted ways.&nbsp;</p><p>After the divorce, she met&nbsp;the famous <a href=# rel=follow>Friends star</a> LeBlanc in 1997.&nbsp;The model met him through their mutual friend, Kelly Phillips, and her husband <a href=# rel=follow>Lou Diamond Phillips</a>.</p><p>From dating to being&nbsp;engaged in just a year, the couple's relationship progressed fast.</p><p>Five years later,&nbsp;they&nbsp;had&nbsp;one of the biggest celebrity weddings in Hawaii. The guest list included 150 people, including Matt's castmates from Friends along with their spouses. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>McKnight with her ex husband Matt LeBlanc. </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>The union was the first for the Friends actor. He could not stop gushing about how his wife made his life a little more&nbsp;stable. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;before their marriage, LeBlanc&nbsp;stated:</p><p>Relationship with McKnight and her children gave me stability. They’re great kids. It’s been a fantastic experience. I’m very grateful for them in my life. Because before them, I was out at the bars, I was chasing chicks all over the place, I had kind of a reputation.</p><p>The couple experienced true marital bliss when they were&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blessed</a> with a baby daughter, Marina Pearl McKnight, in 2004.&nbsp;</p><h2>Melissa and Matt LeBlanc's Daughter Had Rare Brain Ailment&nbsp;</h2><p>11 months after their daughter's arrival, an incident left the LeBlanc family shaken. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their daughter was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called Cortical Dysplasia,&nbsp;a congenital problem that causes seizures.</p><p></p><p><strong>An old picture of Matt LeBlanc and his daughter Marina Pearl LeBlanc. </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After a year-long treatment, their daughter became healthier, and it seemed like the couple had weathered the storm. However, that&nbsp;was not&nbsp;the case.</p><h2>Melissa McKnight and Matt LeBlanc's Divorce</h2><p>After one broken marriage, McKnight&nbsp;had the ignominy of facing a similar fate again in her life.</p><p>Her husband, who had a reputation of being a womanizer, reportedly resorted to his old habits of wandering into&nbsp;bars.</p><p>He was spotted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">groping a stripper</a>&nbsp;at an all-nude club&nbsp;while vacationing with his&nbsp;five buddies in British Columbia.</p><p>Though the actor later apologized to his wife, the damage was&nbsp;done.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The final nail in the coffin was the actor's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">extramarital affair</a>&nbsp;with his co-star, Andrea Anders.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, he and McKnight&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for divorce</a> in March 2006, which was completed in the same year in September.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo waved off any spousal support claims, but the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;actor, who has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $80 million,&nbsp;agreed to pay a monthly sum until his daughter turned 18.</p><h2>What Is&nbsp;Melissa McKnight Doing Today?&nbsp;</h2><p>After the divorce, she and LeBlanc&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">took joint custody</a>&nbsp;of Marina. Both of them are looking after their daughter.</p><p>Marina hasn’t been in the spotlight these days.

The duo split in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGianqSVl8BwucSloKyrkWK6pLfNop6hrF2stqy1jKamnZ2cYq6osY2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariana-morais-19970118-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mariana Morais (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
