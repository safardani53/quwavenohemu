Whitney was born in Uganda.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Whitney was born in Kampala, Uganda. She is the youngest of four kids. Her mother is from Uganda, while her dad is from Canada. Her family moved to Canada in 2012.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I went to boarding school in Uganda, so the school system there was definitely a lot harsher and more disciplined, but it was incredible. I had a good time. But there was a lot more opportunity [in Canada], a lot of freedom,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Interview</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY with Whitney and she revealed how important sisterhood and family are to her. “<span class=s1>I actually have two older sisters and I have one older brother. I’m the youngest one in my family, so just my sense of family and community, keeping the people that I love close to me, is so embedded in me because it’s always kind of been like… the five of us moved from Uganda into Canada and had to relearn this entire society,” she said.</span></p><h2>2. Whitney plays Zoya in the new Gossip Girl.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Whitney’s character, Zoya Lott, is one of the main characters of the new Gossip Girl. At the start of the show, Zoya recently moved to New York City and became a freshman at Constance St. Jude’s. She crosses paths with her half-sister Julien, played by <strong>Jordan Alexander</strong>, at school. As Zoya enters Julien’s word, the sisters have their fair share of highs and lows and even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fight over a boy</a>, Obie. The HBO Max series will return for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 2</a>.</p><h2>3. Whitney is a brand ambassador for Chanel.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Whitney was announced as one of Chanel’s US Brand Ambassadors in March 2021.&nbsp; “Honestly, I never dreamed I’d get the attention of such a reputable house, let alone the pleasure of working with and representing them,” she said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>. “I’m looking forward to showing how versatile and timeless Chanel is.”</p><h2>4. Gossip Girl wasn’t her first role.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Whitney’s first role was in the 2017 TV movie&nbsp;Campfire Kiss. She also played Stella in&nbsp;Molly’s Game.&nbsp;Whitney joined Chilling Adventures of Sabrina as Judith in 2019. She also played Alpha Jessica on Home Before Dark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Whitney-Peak-5-Things-Hocus-Pocus-embed-2.jpg><h2>5. Whitney was the victim of a scam.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>She went to her first-ever audition and had several callbacks for shows. “We got down to the final moment and we’re getting a&nbsp;contract. Then they asked us for this hefty fee for an agent and we didn’t know anything about it. We just thought:&nbsp;​<span class=pull-single>‘</span>This is awesome, we’ll pay monthly,'” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Face</a>. Whitney didn’t get any auditions from the agent. Months later, her family realized it was a scam. “We found out and it was heartbreaking. But more than anything, I felt bad that I got my mom into that situation, especially where we were financially at that point,” she continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LEqbXTp5yyZaCarqx5k21ua2pkaXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-paul-walkers-daughter-meadow-rain.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Paul Walker's daughter, Meadow?</span></a>
