Three of Matt's kids were born of average height, while one of his sons (<a href=#>Zach</a>) has achondroplasia.</p><p>The longevity of Little People, Big World is obviously a huge reason why Matt has the net worth he has today.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Matt Roloff do for a living?</h2><p>Per a 2016 report in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, TLC reality TV stars earn anywhere between $1,500 and $3,000 per episode of the shows they film for the network. With this info, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch</a> recently estimated that Matt is likely earning somewhere between $60,000 and $120,000 for each season of Little People, Big World. However, the official details of his salary for the show haven’t been released to the public.</p><p>The farm is another money-making venture that takes up a lot of Matt's time. Matt, who <a href=#>became the sole owner</a> of the family farm in 2020, also successfully transitioned part of it into an amusement park. The amusement park comes fully packed with attractions and rides for other families to enjoy. According to In Touch, about 30,000 guests visit the property annually.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>In recent news, his ownership over Roloff Farms has become a touchy subject. In a recent episode of LPBW, Matt and his adult sons have butted heads over placing a portion of the farm up for sale.</p><p>Part of the farm is currently up for grabs at $4 million. Matt has become increasingly upset at his children, mistakenly believing that they would keep the farm in the family.</p><p>"A lot of people say that I told the kids they would inherit this property," Matt discusses in a confessional, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. "I never said anybody would inherit it. I always said that hopefully, we could keep this as a legacy."</p><p>He's even gone so far as to say that his children have become "a bunch of little monsters."</p><p>Keep up with the ongoing real estate family drama on Little People, Big World. New episodes air Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq61wIyrpqWnlpt6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-nevins.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Nevins</span></a>
