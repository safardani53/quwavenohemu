Net Worth, Career, Salary</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> reportedly spent $14.8 million for Oprah Winfrey’s property in Montecito, California. This piece of news has fans wondering about the Friends actress’ net worth, which is estimated to be about $320 million in August 2023. Given that she makes more than $20 million each year from acting and endorsement contracts, the amount seems to be climbing.</p><p>Winfrey’s estate has a 1.03-acre totally designed Tuscan-style residence with four bedrooms and 3.5 baths. Winfrey, 68, sold the other half of the estate to Bob Greene, her longtime personal trainer, and estate manager, for $2.3 million, which included two cottages. Aniston, 53, who owns a $20.97 million Bel Air mansion, purchased the estate’s principal residence via a trust. That being said, let’s take a closer look at one of Hollywood’s most famous actresses, Jennifer Aniston’s net worth, following the news of her purchasing a multi-million dollar mansion in the posh neighborhood, joining Ariana Grande, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle, Ellen DeGeneres, Rob Lowe, and many others.</p><p></p><h2>Jennifer Aniston allegedly earned a fortune from her role in Friends.</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston’s riches are both astounding and predictable, given that she has been a worldwide superstar for the last 25 years as a result of the popularity of Friends. Even though the series’ last episode aired 18 years ago, its cultural effect has survived, and the sitcom’s performers continue to make millions of dollars each year, despite what may seem to be ridiculous.&nbsp;During the first season of Friends, each of the six main cast members earned $22,500 for each episode. Jen’s salary in the first season was said to be $540,000. Jen’s affair with Ross (David Schwimmer) was a pivotal story piece in the second season, earning her around $960,000.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jennifer-Aniston-1.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>By season three, Aniston had earned her first million dollars ($1.875 million, to be exact). She got $1 million every episode in the final two seasons of Friends, while the whole ensemble earned about $90 million apiece, minus incentives and royalties.&nbsp;The actors agreed to a pact in 2000 that allowed them to earn from repetitions, which is quite unusual. Jennifer Aniston still earns a 2% cut of the show’s $1 billion in streaming and licensing earnings each year, which equates to about $20 million per year.&nbsp;Furthermore, according to Variety, the cast members each got at least $2.5 million following the highly awaited Friends: The Reunion, which previously aired in 2021 on HBO Max.</p><h2>Jennifer Anniston is a well-paid veteran Hollywood actress.</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston has appeared in about 44 films, some of which have grossed more than $200 million at the box office, including Bruce Almighty, Marley & Me, The Break-Up, Just Go With It, Horrible Bosses, and We’re the Millers. She purportedly made $75 million from movie revenues between 1997 and 2011 (she got $10 million from 2011’s Just Go With It alone). Her much-anticipated reunion with Adam Sandler in the forthcoming film Murder Mystery 2 will undoubtedly delight viewers, and considering that the original Murder Mystery is still a Netflix blockbuster, she won’t have to worry about the compensation.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The actress returned to television in 2019 for Apple TV+’s The Morning Show, which earned her a SAG Award and $2 million with co-star Reese Witherspoon. The popularity of the series has already earned the two around $40 million apiece.&nbsp;Jennifer has worked on advertisements and brand collaborations for companies such as Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Loreal Paris, and Emirates Airlines. In September 2021, she even started her own cruelty-free haircare product, LolaVie, on Instagram.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmailaO7qrLEq2SappmowbC6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tIycmKudlad6tK3LmqmyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwyneth-paltrow-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow's Net Worth Is Staggering Thanks to Goop</span></a>
