Former Wales star Tom Shanklin has called for Jonathan Davies to start against England on February 26 following his impressive 13-minute cameo against Scotland.
The ex-centre told the Rugby Union Daily podcast: &#34;He probably doesn't deserve to start at the moment if you're talking about club form.
&#34;Yeah, there'd be loads of credit in the bank but there's probably players in the United Rugby Championship that are playing better than him, but it just shows what experience he has."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
