Jay Versace Made A Name For Himself On Vine</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Remember Vine? Well, once upon a time the video sharing app made a bunch of really creative and hilarious young people very, very internet famous. <strong>Jay Versace</strong> was one of those young people, gaining over 3 million followers before Vine eventually shut down for business. Thanks to his success on Vine, he now has over 300k followers on YouTube and and has over 2 million followers on his Instagram account. Unfortunately, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>due to his drama with <strong>Princeton Perez</strong></a>, both Jay’s Twitter and Instagram were temporarily suspended as of May 25, 2017. It’s unclear if either one of them plan to reinstate their accounts any time soon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2.) Jay Is Making Headlines For Outing Princeton Perez</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>So, why is everyone talking about Jay? The internet celeb got into a nasty beef with Princeton Perez, a member of the boyband <strong>Mindless Behavior</strong>, and even posted some <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>screen grabs of their tense private messages</a> on Twitter. The problem? The screen grabs that Jay decided to share on his Twitter account showed that Princeton, who had not previously come out as a gay man, was asking whether or not another guy was single. In the exchange, Jay suggests that Princeton ask the guy himself whether or not he’s single, but Princeton claims that the guy has “both” of his accounts blocked. He then asks Jay to tell the guy that they are cool so he’ll unblock him, suggesting Princeton really wanted to hit him up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3.) Jay Came Out To His Fans In December 2016</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Princeton may not have come out on his own, but Jay did. In his most watched video on YouTube with over 500k views, Jay&nbsp;shared that he was “coming out” but refused to label himself as gay, straight or bisexual. “Honestly, I don’t want myself… I don’t want to put a label on myself,” Jay explained. “I hate being labeled as this, as this. Jay the Viner, Jay the gay person, Jay the bisexual person. Jay this, Jay that.” You can watch the video in full below:</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — What do YOU think about Jay outing Princeton?
