He first appeared on TV as a weatherman in Tampa. Sager’s dressing sense has always been the flashy kind, it seems. In an interview back in 2013, he revealed that he went to his interview (for the weatherman’s position) wearing a blue, white, and yellow suit. He got the job, but he was not supposed to wear those (on-air) because the cameras of that time couldn't focus on it.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><p>And since then there has been no looking back for Craig Sager.</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nextimpulsesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/150313121909-craig-sager-iso-pregame-return-031315.1200x672.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>From early on his career, he focused his energy on covering sports of the States. After his stint as a weatherman in Tampa, he went on to broadcast Royals spring training and Chiefs' preseason games. It was during the 1970's.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>His professional eccentricities, we have all come to love, could be seen from his early days. Back in the 1970s when he was a reporter, he was waiting for Hank Aaron at third base and interviewed him on the way to home plate after Aaron hit his 715th home run, breaking the record held by Babe Ruth. Sager, who was then a $95 per week news director at a radio station in Sarasota, Florida, literally interviewed Aaron as each jogged from third base to home.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Before becoming a sideline reporter for TNT and TBS, Sager worked for CBS and CNN covering different sports. His commentary has been known to make the games even more interesting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong><u>CRAIG SAGER'S NET WORTH AND SALARY</u></strong></p><p>With a career of more than four decades, Craig Sager earns quite well. With an estimated annual salary of $700,000, Sager is believed to have a net worth of $10 million as of 2016. He must have separated a quarter of his annual earnings for his suits only, don’t you think?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><strong><u>CRAIG SAGER AILMENT</u></strong></p><p>Back in 2014, Craig sager was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.
