The native of Washington, D.C., USA, is the daughter of Lloyd and Yasmin Anderson.</p><p>Aside from their names, any further information detailing their profession and current status is entirely hidden from the media. Also, Anderson has a brother who is a film producer.</p><p>Likewise, Anderson belongs to the African-American ethnic group.</p><h2>Early Life And Education</h2><p>As a young child, Anderson went to the Montgomery Blair High School located in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p><p>There she used to be an announcer at basketball matches. Apart from fulfilling her role as a commentator, Josina also participated in track and field at her school.</p><p>After graduating high school, Anderson enrolled at the University of North Carolina. Even there, she continued as a track and field sprinter, competing in 200 and 400 meters races. She won a gold medal for her outstanding effort at the AAU Junior Olympics.</p><p>Anderson graduated with a degree in Exercise and Sports Science.</p><h2>Age And Height</h2><p>Skilled and passionate, Josina Anderson has already established herself as one of the leading personalities in the reporting world.</p><p>Talking more about her, Josina was born on August 15, 1978, which makes her 45 years old. Also, her zodiac sign is Leo, and people with this sign are known to have fierce personality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/josina-002.jpg><p>The ESPN journalist stands at 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) and weighs around 59 kg (130 pounds).</p><p>Since she was a part of track and field, Anderson has got an athletic body. We are sure, as a public personality, she maintains her health with an appropriate workout regime and diet.</p><p>Along with that, Anderson has got dark brown eyes and long black hair.</p><h2>Early Years As A Journalist</h2><p>With a passion for sports and a degree to help her in the process, Anderson started her career as an intern.</p><p>Right after graduating, Josina worked on WTEM (Washington Radio Station) and two other shows: The <a href=# rel=noopener>Tony Kornheiser</a> Show and The Donnie Simpson Morning Show in 1997.</p><p>After spending most of her youth as an intern at reputed radio shows, Anderson’s career set off when she was hired by the CBS affiliate news channel, Coos Bay in 2000.</p><p>Josina was one of the few journalists to be employed so shortly after her graduation.</p><p>Despite getting a job, definitely an upgrade from her previous ones, her hunger and desire for more led her to consider other options.</p><p>The American reporter printed numerous copies of her resume and collected tapes of her work to send across the country. Sadly, none of them landed her any job opportunities.</p><p>Since she was done waiting for opportunities to come her way, Anderson decided to move to Washington, D.C., on her own accord.</p><p>Upon her return, she moved with her parents and worked as a personal trainer to make ends meet.</p><p>Josina would charge $100 to train her client on the track while still covering for the city’s sports teams, such as Redskins, Wizards, and the mystics, at night. Along with them, she also covered the Georgetown and University of Maryland basketball teams for the local cable news shows.</p><h2>Rise To Stardom – ESPN</h2><p>Things started to turn a new leaf for Josina in 2005 after she joined FOX31, located in Denver, Colorado.</p><p>She had previously auditioned for the same job two years ago but was rejected at that time. Anderson went on and worked with them for six whole years.</p><p>During her time there, Josina reported several important stories, including NFL players doping test back in October 2008, NFL stars <a href=#>Ricky Williams</a> and Travis Henry testing positive for marijuana in July 2008, Charles Woodson and the Packers reaching an agreement on the contract extension in September 2010.</p><p>Not to mention, Anderson also reported for Showtime’s Inside the NFL.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her progress and detailed reporting, Anderson came under the radar of many major networks. The same Josina who was workless a few years ago was now packed with offers, too good to decline.</p><p>Amidst all the eye-catching offers, ESPN was the one Josina accepted. Hence, in 2011, the American reporter, Anderson, moved to Chicago as the new reporter for ESPN.</p><h3>Josina Anderson Out At ESPN</h3><p>There is no doubt that ESPN helped Josina Anderson grow as a reporter. But Josina was no longer with the network by early 2020. Also, as ESPN’s first female national NFL insider back in 2015, Anderson was no longer affiliated with the system.</p><p>According to The New York Post’s Andrew Marchand, the veteran reporter’s departure from the network has nothing to do with the “cutting of personnel related to the coronavirus’ economic impact on Disney and ESPN,” as many claimed.</p><p>After working 9 years with the network, she gained a lot of experience and exposure. The veteran reporter would have no problem getting another job, probably at a rival network like Fox Sports or NBC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Josina-Reporting-For-CBS.jpg><p>At ESPN, Josina’s spot was reportedly filled by reporters including Field Yates, Jeremy Fowler, Dan Graziano, Dianna Russini, and Kimberely Martin.</p><p>After leaving ESPN, she joined CBS Sports HQ and now works as a senior NFL Insider. Besides, she also hosts an NFL show, The Crew NYC, and a podcast ‘Undefined with Josina Anderson.’</p><p>In her podcast, she not only talks about NFL insider knowledge But also discusses on headline news and issues in sports, politics, and society.</p><p>NFL reporter was crushed by netizens after she tweeted about <a href=#>Kylian Mbappe’s</a> performance at the 2022 soccer World Cup.</p><p>She tweeted, “I’m still waiting for Kylian Mbappe to impress me in this World Cup. Yes he attracts defenders, but speed & scoring potential are not enough. You have to purposefully dribble w/ directive control for yourself, & thus be a constant actual threat to the net t/o tourney.”</p><p>“are we watching the same world cup Josina?” replied her fan. Another added, “Wait, what?? Was there another world cup going on because?”</p><h2>Awards And Achievements</h2><p>Without a doubt, Josina Anderson is one of the prominent sports reporters at the moment. Because of her dedication and work ethic, Anderson has won many awards under her name.</p><p>In 2009, Josina received a Heartland Emmy for her quarterback John Dutton coverage and his wife Terina’s trip to Ethiopia to adopt their son Miki.</p><p>Aside from that, she also won a Salute to Excellence award for radio reports in 2014. It was called ‘Outside the Lines and The Sporting Life,’ which featured Brandon Lowe and Dwayne Bray.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Josina Anderson of ESPN Married?</h2><p>Despite being a public personality, Josina Anderson is reserved when it comes to her personal life. Reporter by profession, Anderson is more focused on providing detailed information on the reports than detailing her life to the public.</p><p>As of now, the 45-year-old reporter is still single and focusing on her career.</p><p>Moreover, she has not reported anything when it comes to her life, and even her past relationships are a secret.</p><p>But this does not mean Anderson is free from any rumors and controversies. During her early career, Josina was accused of having an affair with her co-workers.</p><p>However, the significant backlash came in 2014, when she made the on-air report on former St. Louis Rams’ defensive end Michael Sam’s showering habits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Josina-Anderson-Wearing-A-Floral-Dress.jpg><p>She further reported that an unnamed player informed her how Sam, the first openly gay player in an NFL training camp, refused to take a shower with his teammates; and would only do so after they were done.</p><p>Following the news, both ESPN and Anderson came under fire and received numerous threats and condemnation. People from Sam’s teammates to LGBTQ+ activists spoke out against the segment made by Josina.</p><p>Moreover, Ram’s coach Jeff Fisher accused Anderson of being “unethical” and “unprofessional” while calling the segment “manufactures.” Since the situation got way out of hand, Josina and ESPN later issued a public apology.</p><h3>What is Josina Anderson – Myles Garrett’s issue?</h3><p>NFL players Mason Rudolph and Myles Garrett got into an outrageous fight on November 14, 2019.</p><p>Josina Anderson responded to the situation with a tweet. She tweeted, “I would bet Myles Garrett will say he heard Mason Rudolph call him something egregious. Never seen Garrett act like that, ever.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Completely accurate and fair” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9rzigebjTH</a></p><p>— Ty Alexander (@tyalexander05) <a href=#>November 16, 2019</a></p><p>Anderson’s followers dragged the tweet into a negative light deeming it was about race. She then deleted the tweet. Her tweets didn’t stop there.</p><p>She later posted an image from the fight captioning, “What word be used to describe this if an NFL player grabbed a female’s private parts in a non-consensual way? Pause.</p><p>Would that be assault? Male or female, this non-consensual act right here is beyond invasive, provoking and wrong.”</p><p>Nonetheless, Anderson apologized for all the remarks she made.</p><p>She again tweeted, “Mistakes need to be owned and, I will own mine here. With the benefit of additional angles, it’s clear my tweet misinterpreted one of the photos taken during the brawl. That’s my fault, I apologize. My goal is to always be completely accurate and fair.”</p><p>Moreover, Myles Garrett was suspended, and he also published a statement and apology later.</p><h2>Net Worth And Income</h2><p>Josina Anderson worked at ESPN for good 9 years before finally joining CBS.
