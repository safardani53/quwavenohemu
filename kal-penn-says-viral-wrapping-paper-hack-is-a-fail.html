Who is the lucky recipient of those?” one fan <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a>. Another joked that the hack failed because of his gift choice, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>writing</a>, “That’s what you get for gifting socks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Only works on real gifts,” a third user <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>commented.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, other fans echoed Penn’s frustration, revealing that the trick failed when they tried to use it while wrapping their gifts as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Yes it was I’ve tried it like 12 times and it only worked ONCE,” a fan tweeted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I thought the same thing!” a second wrote. “Did a bunch of gift wrapping on Saturday and not one was wrapped diagonally. Instead, some have an extra piece across the bottom that doesn’t match up with the rest of the paper.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hack went viral last week when Waterstones shared a seven-second video of the trick captioned, “This is a public service announcement,” on Twitter. It has since been removed “in response to a report from the copyright holder,” according to a notification on Twitter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before it was taken down, the video showed a wrapper finding they don’t have enough paper to cover their rectangular gift vertically or horizontally, after cutting the piece too small — a frustrating fate every gifter has faced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That’s where their holiday hack came in: They suggested rotating the gift diagonally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once diagonal, the gift was wrapped with ease and covered completely with the same piece of wrapping paper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bookseller then followed up with another tweet that encouraged people to consider reusable bags as a way to wrap gifts as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for more holiday wrapping hacks?
