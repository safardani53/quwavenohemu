Fans absolutely love him, and he is popular for his roles in Hollywood projects including hit movies like Pete’s Dragon&nbsp;(2016), Wonderstruck&nbsp;(2017), and Fort Bliss&nbsp;(2014). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Fegley started out very young and is already a well-respected actor. This clearly makes him no normal teenager, and achieving the amount of success he has is still an astonishing feat.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>How exactly did his career start, and how has it progressed over the past decade? Keep reading to find out. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Oakes Fegley’s&nbsp;Hollywood Family&nbsp;Inspired Him to be an Actor</h2><p>As is typical of child stars in Hollywood, Fegley was also born into a family <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">full of actors </a>and actresses. His parents Michael and Merce Fegley are both actors known for their roles in <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Final Mission&nbsp;(2018) and Samuel’s Game&nbsp;(2014),&nbsp;respectively. That is not all, his two siblings August and Winslow are also prominent child actors.</p><p>His family of actors has clearly had an impact on Fegley. In an<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> interview </a>with The Morning Call in October 2017, Oakley stated that his sister was his biggest inspiration to pursue a career in movies.</p><p>She had such a passion for acting…She really started me on it.</p><h2>He Starred in His Debut Movie at a Tender Age of 9</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Oakes got into the industry very quickly; at the age of 9, he was already shooting his first movie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fort Bliss (2014)</a>. He played the role of Paul, the son of the main character Maggie Swan (Michelle Monaghan) and her ex Richard (Ron Livingston) in the movie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Fegley is quite prevalent throughout the movie and his character is integral to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the plot,</a> which is about soldiers returning from duty in Afghanistan. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As the son of the main character Michelle, he serves as a sort of a link to Michelle and her emotions, hence his portrayal of Paul is essential to the story’s development.</p><h2>Impressive Movie Appearances Showcases Fegley’s Acting Abilities</h2><p>Fegley has received overwhelmingly positive acclaim for his performances. His most prominent movie Pete’s Dragon was a big hit and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forbes called it</a> “terrific and unabashedly emotional”.&nbsp;The director of the movie David Lowery had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this to say</a> about Fegley: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>I can't describe it, but there was something so real about him.</p><p>Even in his 2019 movie Goldfinch, which was rated poorly, Fegley’s performance was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">still applauded</a>&nbsp;by critics; Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw said that he “(did) well with the role.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He Shared Screen With Legendary Actor Robert De Niro</h2><p>Oakes Fegley’s latest appearance was in the movie&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">War with Grandpa</a>, which was released just last month on October 9, 2020. In the movie, he has worked and starred with Robert De Niro, a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">legendary Hollywood sensation</a>.</p><p>Fegley’s character Peter and De Niro’s Ed as his grandfather are the two main characters of the movie. The plot is essentially about Peter having to share a room with his Grandpa and declaring a “war” with him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To star beside a Godfather cast member is an honor for any actor, to be able to do it as a teenager is a truly phenomenal achievement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6SurLHSZp2en5yueqKzxGaumqpdrLa1tIygqZqmlKWub7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-travis-tritt-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Travis Tritt Dating Now</span></a>
