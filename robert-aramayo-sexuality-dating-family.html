He is the story‚Äôs moral compass, satisfied to stay away from courtly intrigues and uncompromising in his concept of loyalty and honor.&nbsp;</p><p>His surname, Stark, indicates his aversion to moral compromise, but his boundaries are increasingly pushed throughout the story.</p><p>Stark is portrayed by Sean Bean in the first season of Game of Thrones, by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sebastian Croft</a> as a kid in the sixth season, and by Aramayo as a young adult in the sixth and seventh seasons.

He revealed that it was challenging to keep the secret since many people asked him about it.</p><p>He said, ‚ÄúIf I remember rightly, I think I had a job in between the first appearance and the second one. I usually just disappear when I work anywhere, so I just managed to avoid it as much as I could.‚Äù</p><p>Overall, he did a fantastic job portraying Stark and the younger version of Bean.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfp7yjsdGtZJqqkaKuuruMrJyxrZGhtrXFjJ2YraGenHqnrcyio7Jn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-sundvold.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Fame | Jon Sundvold net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
