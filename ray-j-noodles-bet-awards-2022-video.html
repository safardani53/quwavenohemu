Yo, Ray, you ain’t eat at home?” That was the question for <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ray J</a></strong> after he was seen dipping into what appeared to be a Nissin Food Cup of Noodles during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 BET Awards</a> on Sunday. Ray J, 41, was in attendance at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, and seeing him pick up the cup and take a quick bite was a bit surreal for those watching. “Ray J’s life really be as chaotic as it seems bro,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> one user, adding, “Where he even cook these noodles?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why is Ray J eating a CUP OF NOODLES at the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#BetAwards</a> ?? <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/nFEjqgflV8</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— 2Cool2Blog (@2cooI2blog) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June 27, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ray J’s on-again/off-again/currently on-again love, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Princess Love</a></strong>, gave fans a closer look at Ray J’s snack. Yes, it was an official Cup of Noodles, and yes, Ray J kept it in one of the cupholders in his seat. “I’m not gonna front,” Princess Love, 37, captioned the video, “I wanted a bite.” The comments section was filled with laughing emojis. “Sissssssss what’s wrong with bro,” wrote <strong>Yandy Smith-Harris. </strong>“He never disappoints with the foolery.” “This is how you do these events!!!” added another. “Bring yo’ own snacks.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>It remains to be seen if Ray J turns this “foolery” into a Cup of Noodles sponsorship. After all, it was one of the highlights of the June 26 event. <strong>Lizzo </strong>started things off in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>explosion of gold</a> and glitter. Speaking of Glitter, <strong>Mariah Carey </strong>made <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a surprise appearance</a> to perform “Big Energy” alongside <strong>Latto</strong>. Mariah’s wasn’t the only surprise appearance of the evening. <strong>Kanye “Ye” West </strong>walked out on the stage <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to deliver a speech honoring</a> <strong>Sean “Puff Daddy”/” Diddy”/” Love” Combs</strong>, who was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award</a>. It might be hard to say Ye, 45, “appeared” on stage since he was covered from head to toe as if he flew in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>from his Wyoming ranch</a> just minutes before.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brandy</strong></a> also made an unexpected appearance during the 2022 BET Awards. Ray J’s sister came out during <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jack </strong></a><b>Harlow’s</b>&nbsp;set, seemingly putting together their awkward feud from May 2022. The two performed her remix of his chart-topping hit, “First Class,” and ended in a warm embrace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ray-j-eats-cup-noodles-at-bet-awards-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>The beef between Brandy and Jack, 24, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came in May</a> during an interview with Hot 97 hosts <strong>Ebrow Darden, Lauren Stylez</strong>, and <strong>Peter Rosenberg</strong>. At one point, the hosts tested his musical knowledge by playing him a snippet of a song and asking him to name the title and artist. After playing “Angel In Disguise,” Jack drew a blank. Rosenberg said that her brother was why a lot of people were famous, referencing Ray J’s sex tape with <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>. Ultimately, Jack admitted he didn’t know Brandy, 43, and Ray J were siblings, which shocked many.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After Jack’s confession, Brandy joked that she would “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>murk this dude in rap at 43 on his own beats and then sing his ass to sleep</a>.” She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>did just that</a> by remixing Jack’s song (which also reminded the world that Brandy was just as talented at rapping as she is at singing.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FwZquZqWK3brrOqJulnaNir6bAjJqumqqUqHpzfJFrZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sohini-sarkars-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Sohini Sarkars Boyfriend: Who is Sohini Sarkar Dating?</span></a>
