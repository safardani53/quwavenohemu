There was also a circular ball pit for the kids to jump into that featured a racetrack around the edges.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kylie Cosmetics founder’s baby boy</a> was gifted two kids’ cars to drive and an orange motorcycle for when he’s able to ride around on his own.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kardashians</a> star, who shares both <a href=#>Stormi, 5, and Aire, 12 months</a>, with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>, made sure the race car vibe spread to the outside as well. She put up a fake road with balloons that read “Route 1” and led to the tunnel that was left over from the Stormi’s World bash.</p><p>The “Route 1” decorations paid homage to Aire’s age, as well as the historic roadway that stretches along the coast of California and beyond.</p><p>“AIRE. my son, my moon, my stars. best year of my life with you,” <a href=#>Jenner wrote via Instagram</a> alongside a video montage of her youngest child. “You complete us my angel. mommy loves you. happy 1st birthday. may God always bless you.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian </strong></a>also paid tribute to Aire on his special day, sharing a picture of the little man with her 5-year-old daughter, Chicago.</p><p>“Happy birthday sweet Aire! We love you so much!” the Skims founder, 42, wrote via her Instagram Story on Thursday. “The cousins just adore you and can’t wait to always play with you! We got you for life! We can’t wait for a lifetime of memories.”</p><p>Jenner and Scott, 30, initially introduced their fans to their son as Wolf, after his February 2022 arrival. However, the mother of two revealed one month later that the baby’s name <a href=#>had changed</a>.</p><p>“FYI our son’s name isn’t Wolf anymore,” the Life of Kylie alum wrote via her Instagram Story at the time. “We just really didn’t feel like it was him. <a href=#>Just wanted to share because I keep seeing Wolf everywhere</a>.”</p><p>Less than two weeks before her second child’s birthday, Jenner finally gave fans a glimpse of the little one’s face and <a href=#>revealed his moniker</a>. “I love you Aire Webster,” grandma <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> commented on the January 21 Instagram post.</p><p>Us Weekly broke the news last month that Kylie and the “Sicko Mode” rapper called it quits. The pair have been <a href=#>dating on and off since 2017</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Kylie and Travis are off again, they were supposed to spend the holidays together, but she went to Aspen to be with her family and friends up there,” <a href=#>an insider exclusively told Us of the duo</a>. “This has happened so many times before, they’re known to be on again off again, but always remain friends and great coparents.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Aire’s 1st birthday bash:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktq%2B%2FyJ2cZqOpobamecmepaedoqh6tLvNZpiiqpWoenK%2F02aZoqqknbGixYypmKusqWK9qbvTqKpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-landis-jfk-assassination-claims-the-final-witness-7966788.html><span>←</span><span>Agent Paul Landis Makes Startling Claim About JFK Assassination in New Book</span></a>
