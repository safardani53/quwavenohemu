The 15-year-old son of La La and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Carmelo Anthony</a> </strong>stood <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a head taller</a> than his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother</a>, clearly taking after his 6’7”-tall father. Kiyan sported a white tracksuit that boasted lavender racing stripes that matched the purple on his shoes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/la-la-anthony-with-son-kiyan-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>La La dressed more glam for the launch. The author, television personality, and entrepreneur wore a sparkly bronzed outfit that featured a lot of cleavage. The two-piece look featured a crop top with a strategic cutout that flaunted La La’s ample curves and a pair of high-waisted pants that hugged every inch of her figure.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/la-la-anthony-with-son-kiyan-ss-embed1.jpg alt width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>A week before her event in New York City, La La spoke about raising her son with her ex. “Co-parenting is amazing. We want to be a great example to our son. We have open conversations with him, like we tell him, ‘You were made from love. We’re still a family,’” she said <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in an interview</a> with The Hollywood Reporter. “We do things together. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>We go to his games together</a>. We try to keep it as normal as possible. I do it for my son. I don’t want my son to look at his parents like, ‘They didn’t get along, or they were arguing all the time,’ because he’s looking at us as an example of relationships he’s going to have in the future.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>La La and Melo married in 2010. Over the last handful of years, the couple had an on-again/off-again relationship until La La<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> filed for divorce in June 2021</a>. “I think that stepping away from that marriage was such an incredibly hard decision for me,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>THR</a>, “but it made me realize there’s nothing I can’t do. Staying is easier. Walking away is harder. Staying in your comfort zone — what you know, your house, your kid is happy cause their parents are together — that’s easier.” La La shared that she was with Melo since “he was 19 years old, like that’s all I’ve known,” and to step away from that to “build my own life” was scary. “I had to figure out what I needed to do then. And I’m still figuring out what I’m doing now,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BwZqWZXaGubq3NrZ%2BopqliwLC6jKSgspmeYsGiuMtmpZ6vXa68s7eMnKCtsV2ltbDAzqxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kieffer-delp-jenelle-evans-ex-is-finally-getting-out-of-jail.html><span>←</span><span>Jenelle Evans' Ex Is FINALLY Getting Out of Jail!</span></a>
