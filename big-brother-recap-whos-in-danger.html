While JC is the bigger threat, it seems Angela wants Sam out of the equation in case Tyler takes Sam instead of her at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Tyler worried that JC could be the one to flip the tables on him and got to work to get him made the target.&nbsp;</p><p>"I really need to start thinking about who I want to be sitting next to if I can get to the end,” he revealed to the diary room.&nbsp;</p><p>JC continued to self-destruct and yelled to Tyler that he should win the veto, save him, and naturally, Kaycee would be on the block.&nbsp;</p><p>With that, the houseguests were treated to a performance by Bebe Rexha, but it was obvious there was a lot of tension in the house.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/angela-rummans-743x1024.jpg><p>Angela closed the episode by nominating JC and Sam, noting that she could not win against either of them because she has not played the most loyal game.&nbsp;</p><p>She has a point, despite the competition wins, she’s one of the most unlikable houseguests in the history of the series.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think of all of this?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Big Brother continues Wednesday on CBS!</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Big Brother: Meet the Most Controversial Houseguests</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WGcK7IoGSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjKucnJmgYsSpu9JmoKdllJa7qLHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angela-rye.html><span>←</span><span>Angela Rye</span></a>
