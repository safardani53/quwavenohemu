<a href=# aria-label="Reliant (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reliant</a>.</p><p>Data collected by the outlet shows that dryers account for a staggering six percent of all electricity used in the <a href=#>United States</a> per year.</p><p>With that in mind and the prevention of clothing material deteriorating over time, a ladder-based laundry rack could be beneficial to Americans' wallets.</p><p>The end goal is to have the ladder hanging parallel to the ceiling in the laundry room or the homeowner's room of choice.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Laundry Hacks">Read More on Laundry Hacks</h2><p>It shouldn't get in the way, looks unique in a living space, and allows for hang-drying.</p><p>Building the ladder drying rack should only take about three to four hours, and can be sanded and painted to fit the right design to compliment the interior of a <a href=#>house</a>.</p><p>To start the build, several supplies are required.</p><p>Along with the ladder, sanding materials, and paint, homeowners should pick up six hooks with screws on the ends for attachments to the ceiling and the ladder, four chains for the ladder to hang from, and shower hooks for the clothes to rest on.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Here's how to complete the DIY process.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 1</h2><p>After gathering the materials, it's recommended that homeowners sand the later completely first.</p><p>Bumps or old paint marks will need to be removed to make room for a fresh coat of paint.</p><p>It will also help the ladder look more aesthetic in the living space.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 2</h2><p>Painting comes next, and can be coated in whatever color or <a href=#>design</a> suits homeowners' likeness.</p><p>A second coat might be needed, and the ladder should be given plenty of time to dry.</p><p>Varnishes are strongly advised against as wet clothes could ruin it — paint coats provide a water-proof seal, according to Reliant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 3</h2><p>Add coats of paint that contrast the ladder to the shower curtain hooks as desired.</p><p>Allow them to dry.</p><p>The chains can also be painted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 4</h2><p>Put the shower curtain hooks on the ladder rungs in a relatively even distribution across the rungs.</p><p>The rungs can also be used for hanging, but shower hook attachments allow for more clothes to be hung across the space.</p><p>Homeowners can decide the best positioning for them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 5</h2><p>Screw in the four hooks onto the ladder on the ends of each side rail, parallel to one another.</p><p>They must be evenly spread to keep the ladder balanced when hanging.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 6</h2><p>Add the chains to the ladder hooks.</p><p>It might be worth painting them the same color as the ceiling so they blend into the space more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 7</h2><p>Use the two remaining hooks and screw them into the ceiling so two chains from one end of the ladder can be attached to one hook, and the two chains from the other end to the second hook.</p><p>It's vital that the chains are sturdy enough to hold the ladder's weight.</p><p>The hooks on the ceiling should also be carefully positioned to hang the chains at each end of the ladder appropriately.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STEP 8</h2><p>Hang the ladder up on the ceiling using the hooks.</p><p>Two chains should be attached to each hook in the ceiling.</p><p>If there's space and the hanging attachment doesn't work out, the ladder could also be leaned against a nearby wall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BE CAREFUL</h2><p>It's also important to ensure safety in the DIY process, especially if homeowners need to cut the ladder down to size before the first step, per <a href=# aria-label="HGTV (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">HGTV</a>.</p><p>Make sure safety goggles are worn and the ladder is painted in an area with ventilation.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title
