numerous scandals related to the content of two controversial books, neither of which she had a hand in writing.</p><p>Back in January, <a href=#>Prince Harry’s memoir</a> hit stores, and soon after, Meghan found herself on the receiving end of some of the harshest criticism of her career.</p><p>And just as the tension between the Sussexes and the rest of the royals began to subside, a new literary controversy emerged.</p><p>This one had to do with a book written by journalist Omid Scobie, a longtime supporter of Harry and Meghan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1728281421-682x1024.jpg><p>Scobie makes no effort to conceal his pro-Sussex bias, so it was assumed that the book would only benefit Harry and Meghan.</p><p>Instead, it created some major headaches for the couple.</p><p>The trouble began when a Dutch translation of the book was sent out with an un-redacted passage that identified <a href=#>King Charles and Kate Middleton as the royals who made racist comments</a> to Meghan during the brief time she lived in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1487943074-1024x740.jpg><p>Even though Meghan was the obvious victim in the encounter described by Scobie, the allegations against Charles and Kate wound up rebounding on the Duchess of Sussex.</p><p>Shortly after news of the scandal became public, one UK politician called for <a href=#>Harry and Meghan to be stripped of their royal titles</a>.</p><p>And a prominent British tabloid journalist has predicted that <a href=#>Meghan will be dropped by her talent agency</a> as a result of this latest round of bad press.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682238743-1024x683.jpg><p>It’s unlikely that Meghan will suffer any consequences quite that severe — after all, she’s the victim in all of this.</p><p>But even the Sussexes’ biggest supporter in the media believes that the most recent royal scandal might require Meghan to put her career plans on hold.</p><p>Speaking with Newsweek about the rumors that Meghan is working on a memoir, <a href=#>Scobie revealed</a> that he believes such a move would be ill-advised at this time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1798061796-1024x683.jpg><p>“To gain the respect of the reader, you have to be completely human in your portrayal, transparent in your portrayal of yourself,” he told the outlet.</p><p>“It has to be candid, it has to be embarrassing in places, it has to be all of these things to be the true portrait of a human being rather than the varnished image of a public figure that wants to be seen in a certain way,” the author continued.</p><p>“And it’s why I think his [Harry’s] book would always be more interesting than say if Megan wrote a memoir, because I think Megan has a much more curated take on what her image is and how it should be. Harry has always been a very candid, candid man.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1180634749-1024x683.jpg><p>It was a diplomatic response from Scobie that skirted the issue of how Meghan’s potential memoir might have been impacted by the current scandal.</p><p>But he made a valid point in his assertion that Meghan is more careful with her public image because she has to be.</p><p>It’s a set of circumstances that would make a memoir a very risky undertaking for the duchess.</p><p>But there may come a time when Meghan has no choice but to set the record straight in her own words.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2FcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55krqqXmrFuwM5mm56kka56sbjAp6pmnp%2BnerWxy6VkmqScYrqmuc6iqWaZnZ6xbr7OspilZaKWsKq%2FzGaqnJmema6tew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colin-blunstone-19450624-html.html><span>←</span><span>Colin Blunstone (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
