The reality star gave birth on Tuesday, June 14.</p><p>“It is so surreal that we are actually here! I can’t wait to meet our daughter!” Gries, 25, captioned an Instagram photo from the hospital. Hours later, she posted the first picture of her newborn daughter.</p><p>“We did it!” she wrote. “8lbs 4oz, 18.5, born at 6:23PM on 6/14/16.” Gries and her husband, Nick Williams, named their little one Skyla. Gries, married since last year, documented the hospital stay on Snapchat.</p><p>Skyla isn’t the only <i>Big Brother </i>baby, of course. Former season 12 contestants <b>Rachel Reilly</b> and <b>Brendon Villegas </b>welcomed daughter Adora in April. That same month, <i>Us Weekly </i>exclusively confirmed that season 11 fan favorite couple <a href=#><b>Jordan Lloyd </b>and <b>Jeff Schroeder</b> are expecting</a> their first child together. The couple quietly married in March and are now gearing up for a baby boy.</p><p>Gries was a controversial figure during her turn on the CBS series in season 15. She famously made headlines for making racist and homophobic remarks toward other houseguests, and later defended herself <a href=#>during an interview with host <b>Julie Chen</b>.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/aaryn-gries-big-brother-73ab5eb5-e846-4226-b84b-afd0641bd8e8.jpg><p>“Being Southern, it is a stereotype and I have said some things that have been taken completely out of context and wrong. I do not mean to ever come off racist,” the Texas native told Chen in August 2013. “That is not me and I apologize to anyone I have offended for that.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>“I really feel bad that this is how it has been seen and how I’ve come across to people,” she continued. “I don’t want to seem like that person and I really do respect everyone in this game, although we have had some really hard times because we’re all fighting for our lives in the game.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaboZdir7O706Gcq2WRocKuecCaqbKmXZy%2FqrHSZp6irpWoeqO10a2fZqyfYq%2BirthmnqKqnGK9qbvTqGSwamFlfnd%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomez-new-look.html><span>←</span><span>Some Fans Are Confused by Selena Gomez's New Look</span></a>
