Somewhere for the kids to play safely? Or maybe you want to grow your own fruit and veg?</p><p>According to the experts, even a makeover of a small garden can cost around £5,000.</p><p>Gardener, author and horticultural broadcaster Ellen Mary told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Homes</a>: “Budgets vary vastly on your garden space and design, from the materials used to the plant choices, furniture and hard landscaping.</p><p>“In general, for a small space you might be looking at a minimum of £5,000 upwards and for a large garden the costs can soon sky rocket, so have an idea what your budget is and look at what you can achieve with that amount. Don’t let the cost put you off though because many gardens can be designed on a small budget.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mybuilder.com</a> estimates that installing a new patio will cost around £80 per square metre.</p><p>Laying real grass can cost around £10 to £20 per square metre.</p><p>Artificial turf costs around £60 per square metre although it will need less maintenance in the future.</p><p>When it comes to laying a path, expect to pay around £500.</p><p>Don’t forget to include any extra costs which may not be so obvious, such as hiring a skip for all the waste materials which will need removing. This can cost between £150 and £300.</p><p>There are some jobs that can make a big difference which can be done by yourself with minimal cost, such as weeding and mowing your lawn, tidying paths and patios and even using a pressure washer to bring garden features back to life.</p><h2>Should I order a landscape gardener and how much money should you spend on landscaping?</h2><p>For those with a bigger budget, you may want to consider bringing in a landscape gardener as while this can be expensive it will save you lots of time and hard work.</p><p>Once again the cost will vary depending on what exactly you want done and how much space you have.</p><p>If you have a large garden and want a complete overhaul which may involve planning, adding patio or decking, laying new turf, constructing paths and borders etc you can expect the cost to run into several thousands of pounds.</p><p>That’s usually before the cost of plants and garden furniture is added on top.</p><p>To help keep costs down always do your research and it will help if you know what exactly you want doing.</p><p>Always get several quotes too from professionals and check any reviews previous customers may have given.</p><p>If cost is an issue, you may want to avoid an established gardener and instead hunt out one that has recently graduated or set up their own business.</p><p>In trying to establish their name and reputation, they may charge less than companies that have been running for a number of years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703184446.jpg><h2>How much does a garden deck cost?</h2><p>The price of decking can vary widely with the total amount dependant on the wood used and just how big you want it.</p><p>Estimates can start at around £15 per square metre for cheaper woods like pine but can increase to £80 per square metre if you want to use more durable and hard-wearing woods, according to MyBuilder.com.</p><p>For a typical 20m square deck you can expect to pay between £300 and £1,600.</p><p>If you want composite decking prices range between £80 to £120 per square metre.</p><p>Those prices don’t include fitting costs which can cost between £150 to £200 per day with it taking, on average, three days to construct which includes preparing the ground, setting the joists and installing the decking.</p><h2>How much does retaining a wall cost?</h2><p>Many gardens feature a retaining wall as it can be used as a landscaping feature as well as serving a practical function, helping to stabilise sloping land or prevent soil erosion.</p><p>Costs, once again, vary depending on how big the wall is and the materials used although they are not cheap.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Checkatrade.com</a> the average retaining wall installation cost is £9,870 for a 6ft high wall.</p><p>While smaller walls, around 3ft high can be installed by the keen DIYer, bigger walls will need expert planning on ensure they are built to last.</p><p>The cost can rise dramatically though if you want to build a taller wall or if it is placed on sloping land.</p><p>The site estimates that building a 10ft high wall on sloping land will cost, on average, £19,344.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Then on top of that you will have to pay a builder to install it.</p><p>For a straightforward wall a builder may charge between £38-46 per hour although the cost will be higher if there are complications such as accessibility issues.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman jet washes her garden and finds a patio she didn't know existed</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoRzfJZqbmxnl5a%2FpbHNZqSao5Wkw6a%2BjJymrKxdnby4ecyumqFloKe2pLHSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boyband-by-myself-song-never-knows-best-anime-flcl-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Talks By Myself, New Project &amp;amp; Anime Influences Hollywood Life</span></a>
