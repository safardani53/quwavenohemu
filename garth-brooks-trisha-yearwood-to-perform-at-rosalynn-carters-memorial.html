And the statement doesn’t have to be more than a few words to get your point across. She was great at that, and everyone loved her for that.”</p><p>The Carter Center confirmed Rosalynn’s death in a statement on November 19.</p><p>“Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, a passionate champion of mental health, caregiving, and women’s rights, passed away Sunday, Nov. 19, at 2:10 p.m. at her home in Plains, Georgia,” the statement read. “She died peacefully, with family by her side.”</p><p>Rosalynn is survived by her husband Jimmy, who is currently <a href=#>in hospice care</a>, her four children — sons Jack, Chip and Jeff and daughter Amy — 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” Jimmy shared in a statement. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it.
