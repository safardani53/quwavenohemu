Yes, Snooki donned the same bunny costume that she made (in)famous during her days of pounding shots and dry-humping strangers on the boardwalk."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I feel like we’re a family so it’s tough. I didn’t know how to react.”</p><p>At that point, Mike Sorrentino stepped up and finally admitted that he had more to do with the previous day’s drama than Deena.</p><p>After all, it was Mike who had been digging into Angelina Pivarnick’s divorce, and Mike who proposed the idea of inviting Ange on his podcast so that JWoww could confront her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I sort of feel bad for my part in the situation,” Mike admitted, although he later hinted that he hadn’t really done anything wrong.</p><p>“I think it was a miscommunication,” he said in a confessional.</p><p>Later in the episode, Mike’s recent shadiness came up again when he was called out by Vinny Guadagnino, of all people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The sexual tension between Vinny and Angelina has been a running joke for years, and Guadagnino studiously avoided the conversation about Pivarnick’s “WAP” during lunch.</p><p>But interestingly, Vin also came to the defense of his fellow Staten Island resident during his conversation with Mike.</p><p>“Mike has been acting messy lately,” Vin said in a confessional.</p><p>He also accused Mike of failing to take care of his “side of the street” before meddling in other people’s affairs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In his conversation with Sorrentino, Guadagnino was more diplomatic, but he still made his feelings clear.</p><p>“Of course you’re gonna talk sh-t and then be nice to her,” Vin said of Mike’s allegedly two-faced behavior toward Angelina.</p><p>In the end, Mike conceded that he’s been acting a bit too much like the shady “Old Sitch” of yore in recent weeks.</p><p>But will he really change his ways?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And in the meantime, are we witnessing a comeback from Angelina?</p><p>She’s been the queen of sketchy behavior in the wake of her <a href=#>divorce from Chris Larangeira</a>.</p><p>But last night, the roommates seemed to sort of have her back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Then again, they all basically refused to stop communicating with her ex, or even to call out Zack Carpinello, who — lest we forget — <a href=#>groped Angelina while JWoww was passed out </a>like three feet away.</p><p>Perhaps the next phase of Shore will be Angelina’s redemption arc.</p><p>Or maybe the stars will just keep getting sloshed and going to amusement parks.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WGcMLIp6WyZZeqrqWtxqegp6ddl7miv9OsZKahm5p6tLvRq5ynrJmjvG7Fzq6tnmWSmrKvecCcq6Kml2LAqa3DsmStp6eWv6V5wKeenqSZo65uvMivmKummZi4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jeannie-bisaccia-rich-bisaccia-wife-age-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Jeannie Bisaccia, Rich Bisaccia Wife?
