On Thursday, August 27, the 28-year-old transformed the backyard of her Arizona home and 18 models hit the runway to show off 26 looks from her pre-fall collection.</p><p>Only a select few people were in attendance, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the fashion show certainly packed a punch on social media. The Bachelor alum went live from the brand’s Instagram account and then posted a video of the entire show to IGTV. The 22-minute video has since amassed close to 75,000 views.</p><p>The Virginia native’s husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Arie Luyendyk Jr.</strong></a> and their 15-month-old daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alessi</strong></a>, were also in attendance. Burnham snapped some adorable photos with her little girl on the runway and dressed her in a burgundy ensemble with a matching headband and silver <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a>.</p><p>Burnham wore an outfit from her line, of course! She stunned in an oversized blazer and white boots. She accessorized with layered necklaces and wore her hair in a sophisticated low ponytail.</p><p>The blonde beauty officially launched her fashion line on August 18. “I’m very emotional about it,” she<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> exclusively told Us via Zoom</a> while we chatted about the collection. “It’s just been such a long time in the making and it’s finally happening.”</p><p>Even though the reality star is well-known for her time on The Bachelor, her brand name has nothing to do with the ABC show — yes, even though it has the word “rose” in it. For her, the flower “symbolizes femininity and the shades part of that is just embracing every different shade of who you are.”</p><p>“I want people to see the brand as inspiration to embrace themselves,” she continued. “Whether they are a different race, a different sexuality, they have different beliefs. I want it to be all-encompassing.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to check out photos from the pre-fall fashion show!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvLmqyrnZ5ir7a%2BzaGYpmWRo7FurcueqqyhXZbBbn3SrWSsoJGZsrR5zp9kq6ejmnqnrdKhoKimXai1sMOMqaCcq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julian-araujo.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Julian Araujo net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
