While presenting at the <a href=#>2022 Emmys</a>, <a href=#><strong>Mindy Kaling</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>B. J. Novak</strong></a> weren’t afraid to take inspiration from their dating history.</p><p>“<a href=#>To all the nominees we want to say</a>, congratulations you lazy sons of bitches. How are you getting away with it? We did 22 [episodes] a year. It would take up your whole life. [There] was no time for other projects and no time for a social life. You had no choice but to form complicated relationships with your costars,” Kaling, 43, joked while <a href=#>presenting the Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie award</a> on Monday, Sunday 12.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mindy-Kaling-BJ-Novak-Joke-About-Complicated-Costar-Romances-Emmys-002.jpg><p>Novak, 43, for his part, added: “Now you can just write some self-contained masterpiece, cast it with movie stars, Shoot it for a few weeks and go back to your fancy luxury compound. Maybe you shot the whole thing at your fancy luxury compound in all honesty.”</p><p>The former costars, <a href=#>who dated from 2004 to 2007</a> while working on <a href=#>The Office</a>, have candidly addressed <a href=#>their close-knit friendship over the years.</a></p><p>The Vengeance director, for his part, discussed the challenges that come with <a href=#>trying to move on after collaborating on nine seasons of the hit NBC sitcom</a>. “Whenever we date anyone else, I think there’s a period where the person is very skeptical of our friendship,” he told Entertainment Weekly in 2013 about his bond with Kaling. “‘Everyone seems to think you two might be a couple, and I don’t mean to get in the way. Are you sure you’re not dating? Are you sure you’re not going to end up dating?’ It’s such a common thing to have that platonic best friend that becomes a little weird when you start dating someone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mindy-Kaling-BJ-Novak-Joke-About-Complicated-Costar-Romances-Emmys-0001.jpg><p>Kaling also weighed in on <a href=#>her “weird as hell” connection with Novak</a>, telling InStyle in 2015, “He is not my boyfriend, but he is not my best friend. I guess you could describe our relationship as a ‘romantically charged camaraderie with loud arguments,’ but I don’t think Facebook would accept this as a new status.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Mindy Project star, who is the <a href=#>mother to daughter Katherine, 5, and son Spencer, 2,</a> recently opened up about her reaction to fans <a href=#>thinking Novak is the father of her children</a>. “It doesn’t bother me,” she told Marie Claire in August. “He’s the godparent to both my kids — and they have such a great relationship.”</p><p>The Massachusetts native added: “So [the speculation hasn’t] affected my happiness at all, it hasn’t affected my kids or BJ. If that’s what is going to be titillating to people, I’ll take it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSippSueqyty6KloGWSYrduus6vmKRlmqS4pnnAm6aurF2lrrTAjKumppmemLJurdNmnKalqah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./loren-brovarnik-alexei-is-leaving-me-with-the-baby-for-8-days.html><span>←</span><span>Loren Brovarnik: Alexei is Leaving Me with the Baby for 8 Days!</span></a>
