"We are excited to embark on a new adventure in Flagstaff, AZ!"</p><p>We’re sure that Flagstaff appreciates their enthusiasm.</p><p>"We are looking forward to cooler temperatures, the mountain air, scenic views, and the slower lifestyle of Flagstaff."</p><p>A lot of that sounds so great. And, after Vegas, just about any lifestyle sounds slower — even if you’re still a reality star.</p><p>Also, you know that the climate is unbearable in Vegas when people are looking forward to the cooler temperatures in Arizona.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/robyn-brown-kody-brown-and-janelle-brown-1024x667.png><p>As you may recall, the Browns moved to Las Vegas in 2011.</p><p>Polygamy is illegal in Utah.</p><p>While those laws may have been a well-intentioned effort to prevent abuses that sometimes go along with polygamist Mormon offshoots (such as child marriage), it can make life difficult for consenting adults.</p><p>So Kody and his wives essentially fled the state. They’ve sacrificed a lot in order to raise awareness and campaign for the legalization of polygamy.</p><p>Now, they’re moving again — into a Flagstaff cul-de-sac with enough space to accommodate Kody, his wives, and their children.</p><p>(Well, the 10 children who are still living at home)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As the good folks over at <a href=#>The Ashley</a> noted, Janelle Brown celebrated the Fourth of July in Flagstaff, and spoke about it on Instagram.</p><p>"Had the great fun of attending a small town 4th of July parade in Flagstaff, AZ," Janelle writes.</p><p>Janelle continues: "Maddie, Caleb, Axel, Savanah, Garrison and I ran away from the heat for a few days."</p><p>Flagstaff is in the upper 70s today, which isn’t exactly cool but it’ll at least mean lower air-conditioning bills.</p><p>"This small town parade is popular," Janelle boasts. "Bringing in 20,000 spectators every year."</p><p>Janelle is already touting the local attractions for perspective tourists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Janelle wasn’t done hyping up her experience.</p><p>"It was so much fun. Plus the temp was in the low 80s!" Janelle gushes, clarifying that this is "30 degrees cooler than home!"</p><p>Some folks consider all temperatures above 70 degrees to be slight variations of "too hot," but others embrace the heat. Some people actually enjoy 80-degree weather! it takes all types.</p><p>"The coolest thing that happened was the huge cheer that went up for the wild land firefighters," Janelle continues. "Both BLM and Forest Service."</p><p>And she makes it very clear why they are particularly important at the moment.</p><p>"With all the fires burning in the West right now," Janelle reminds her fans and followers. "They really are heroes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The looming threat of out-of-control wildfires sweeping through and destroying your home is enough to keep plenty of people from moving to the American southwest unless they have no other choice.</p><p>But the Browns are choosing this, and it might be good for them.</p><p>Certainly, this move will have to be less emotional than their departure from Utah.</p><p>At that time, they were fleeing from potential prosecution for living their lives as consenting adults.</p><p>While many believe that Kody is absolutely the wrong person to be one of the "faces" of modern-day polygamy, the Browns have given up a lot to campaign for a future in which the marital choices of adults are respected.</p><p>And we’re sure that they’ll continue to do so in Flagstaff.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Meri Brown: 19 Shocking Facts About the Sister Wives Star!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcLfOnbBmmqKkxK95wKebZqyYmnq0tdKtnKtlp57Dpr%2BMmqmeZZyarre1zaBkpZmjYsOms8CsZKanpp67qHnTqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenny-taft.html><span>←</span><span>Jenny Taft Bio [2023 Update]: Early Life, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
