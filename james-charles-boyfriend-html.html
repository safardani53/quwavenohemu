The two frequently make TikToks and YouTube videos together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rumors about them dating started in late November 2020 when Larray <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a TikTok</a> with Charles, promoting his Girlies merch.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The two did the "Couples Only Challenge,"&nbsp;They answered various questions about their alleged relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, Noah Beck, another TikToker, was also on the video. But when he realized&nbsp;it was a&nbsp;'Couples Only Challenge,' he threw&nbsp;a peace sign and walked out of the frame.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After that, Charles and Larray answered questions like "Who said I love you first?" and "Who is more romantic?" The video has over three million likes, and it is one of Larray's most viewed TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>This collaboration fueled many rumors about Larray being Charles' boyfriend, but neither confirmed it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Therefore, it seems like the video was only to promote the Girlies merch since Larray was dating <a href=# rel=follow>Brady Potter</a>&nbsp;back then.&nbsp;The two were together for three years before breaking up in September 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>James Charles' Relationship Rumors</h2><p>Ever since Charles came into the spotlight in 2016, many people have been assumed to be his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">boyfriend</a>.</p><p>He was close with the Dolan Twins, and the trio often collaborated&nbsp;alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Emma Chamberlin</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>One-half of the Dolan Twins, <a href=# rel=follow>Grayson Dolan</a>, was assumed to be Charles' boyfriend. However, both of them denied the speculations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Charles has also been linked with Manny MUA and Beck, but once again, all the parties involved denied the rumors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In February 2020, the beauty mogul went on a date with&nbsp;gamer Turner Tenney, best known as&nbsp;'Ttfue.'</p><p>However, it is unknown if the date led to something more.</p><p>Charles was involved in two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">controversial</a> relationships. One was with an Instagram model named Gage Gomez, and another was Sam Cooke. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Charles took Gomez to Coachella in 2019, where the latter accused the YouTuber of harassment.</p><p>Gomez said he was not interested in Charles, yet he was forced to be in various intimate situations.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Charles denied all the allegations and said everything between him and Gomez was consensual. Soon after the Gomez-Charles' controversy, <a href=# rel=follow>Tati Westbrook</a> accused the beauty mogul of misbehaving with a waiter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The waiter was Cooke, with whom Charles allegedly acted inappropriately and tried to manipulate him. Initially, Cooke corroborated with Westbrook's statement but later denied it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Did James Charles Steal Morgan Robb's Boyfriend?</h2><p>While Charles was under fire for grooming minors and texting straight men, Robb added fuel to the fire, claiming that Charles had done the same with her ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>In a now-deleted TikTok, she accused him of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">allegedly stealing</a> her partner two years ago. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apparently, Robb's then-boyfriend was on Tinder, where Charles flirted with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb's friends claimed the guy was 15 at the time, but the TikToker did not confirm the age.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRorK0ecKhmKuklah6o7vYn6minZ6Ze6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-the-joker-tattoo-mean-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>What Does the Joker Tattoo Mean on TikTok?
