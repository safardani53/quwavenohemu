Apparently, Nikki has relations with both cast members! It will be extremely interesting to see how this one plays out.</p><h3><a href=# rel=noopener>Nicki Minaj: See Pics Of Nicki And Her Current BF Meek Mill</a><a href=#>&nbsp;Here</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>This is definitely a sticky situation to be in, especially for&nbsp;an introduction to reality television. But Safaree is no stranger to scandal. The producer previously dated <strong>Nicki Minaj</strong>, 33, for 12 years before they split in 2014. And while the couple had some sweet moments together, the end was far from it! Following their split, the exes have often been in the tabloids disputing over Safaree’s alleged cheating. And Nicki even called him out in May 2016 after he slapped her with a lawsuit to the rights to her past music. She responded to the suit, by calling him a thief! Ouch!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>There’s no word how that lawsuit worked out for Safaree just yet, but he says his appearance on the reality show will give him the clean slate he needs. “I’m just rebuilding myself. I put my life on hold long enough so now I’m finally able to focus on myself and you know, show the world what I’m made of and make the best of every situation I’m in, and I’m just trying to let people know I’m my own person,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood is set to premiere on VH1 on August 15, at 8p.m. We’ll just have to see if Safaree’s “rebuilding” includes Nikki or not!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of the Love & Hip: Hollywood trailer? Will you be watching this season?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH15e49tZqehk6C2brnIp5ijZZWteqO72J%2Bpop2emXqtu9WeZKGhoGK1sLyMoaalpKmsvLCwjKyYn5mimrJuv8CmrJ6ko2K7qrfKomSmrZSWv7O10mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-evans-admits-im-losing-my-hair-201176.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Evans Admits: &amp;quot;I'm Losing My Hair!&amp;quot;</span></a>
