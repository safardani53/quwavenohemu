I was quoted around $3,200 (£2,500) to replace all the old kitchen tops with black marble.”</p><p>“Unfortunately I couldn’t afford to spend that much on my countertop, so I looked online for cheaper options when I came across the ‘marble effect’ spray cans on Amazon.</p><p>"It looked like one of the ‘too good to be true’ products, but a single can cost £7.50 so I took the plunge and bought two.”</p><p>Laura continued: “I then went out and bought a tin of primer for £8.50, two acrylic black paint pots which cost £10 each and an epoxy glaze for £55.”</p><p>“I started by sanding down the kitchen top and painting over one coat of white primer. Some people usually do two or three coats, but we only needed one because we were painting the countertops black.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610002839.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610002754.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610002767.jpg><p>“I then added two coats of the black acrylic paint, let that dry for an hour and sprayed on the white and silver marble effect string. It was a bit like spraying silly string, very fun to do and the white and silver colours really complimented each other.”</p><p>“I then poured over my epoxy glaze and spread it across the counters to finish off the look. Amazingly the project only took five hours to complete, with waiting time for the coats to dry.”</p><p>“We let the glaze sit for two days, and then hey presto a new marble effect kitchen top!”</p><p>“I couldn’t be happier with the results. You’d be surprised how many of my friends actually think it’s expensive marble!”</p><p>“I’m certainly no professional and it was daunting starting the project, but now I’ve done this by myself I want to get started on my next revamp.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What Brittany used to create the look</h3></p><p>£8.50 White Primer</p><p>£21 Black acrylic paint x 2</p><p>£14.98 White & silver marble effect spray can</p><p>£55 Epoxy glaze</p><p><strong>Total cost: £99.48</strong></p><p>The US middle school teacher shared the DIY trick on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> channel. The post to date has accumulated an incredible 10 million views on the platform.</p><p>Brittany said on the post going viral, “I was overwhelmed with the lovely comments from people. I had messages from families telling me they’ve tried the marble effect for themselves and saved a fortune in the process, which makes me feel amazing.”</p><p>Stuart McClure, co-founder of LovetheSales.com, said, “The cost of revamping a kitchen can easily run into the tens of thousands. Brittany’s fantastic hack is perfect for folks that can’t fork out thousands for expensive countertops.</p><p>“We all want to save money in these difficult times, and at LovetheSales.com we encourage our customers to try and be as budget savvy as possible.
