It is more commendable, thinking about how he knew nothing about the sport himself."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The young girl from Japan defeated Serena Williams and won the U.S. Open&nbsp;in 2018 and 2020. With her win, Osaka stirred the Tennis world and the media.</p><p>One of the people responsible for her win was her father, Leonard Francois, whom we will discuss later. Talking about Leonard was born in the small city of Jacmel, Haiti.</p><p>Haitian by nationality and with African ethnicity, young Francois moved to New York City, the United States of America, for studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leonard_Francois_and_Tamaki_Osaka-1024x1024.jpg><p>Sadly, no information regarding college or anything brings his early childhood to light.</p><p>Similarly, the names and whereabouts of his parents and siblings are also unknown.</p><h2>Age and Height | How Old is Leonard Francois?</h2><p>Leonard has not only kept the information on his early life a secret, but his birthdate is also something unknown by the media.</p><p>It is just an assumption, but the father figure was born around the 1980s, which probably means he is in his 40s.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the lack of an exact date, Francois’s zodiac sign is also a mystery to us. And Leonard certainly is not the one to open his mouth unnecessarily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/leonard-001.jpg><p>Likewise, Leonard has dark brown eyes and short black hair. His fit and healthy physique stand at <strong>1.83</strong> <strong>m</strong> (approx.), while his weight and other measurements are unknown.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristina Pink Age, Husband, Reporter, Fox Sports, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></strong></p><h2>Leonard Francois | Personal Life, Wife, and Children</h2><p>Leonard Francois did not have an easy life, especially regarding his marriage with <strong>Tamaki Osaka</strong>, the love of his life.</p><p>During the early 1990s, Japan allowed the first wave of foreigners into their country. Among them, Leonard, a college student, visited Japan.</p><p>Luckily, he met his wife, Tamaki, in Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, the northernmost part of Japan.</p><p>Unlike him, Tamaki grew up in a conservative environment where biracial relationships were not allowed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/leonard-003.jpg><p>At that time, Japan was strict about racial purity, and most children grew up learning those ideologies.</p><p>Similarly, Nemuro, where Tamaki was born, remained faithful to Tokugawa’s decree and maintained a racially pure Japan.</p><p>However, Osaka was a bright student, and all her perceptions changed once she entered high school.</p><p>Because of it, Tamaki was more accepting of Leonard’s approach than other girls at her time.</p><h2>Are Naomi Osaka’s Parents Together?</h2><p>Because of Japan’s culture at that time, Tamaki and Leonard had to hide their relationship in its early phase.</p><p>Considering how racism against people of color is still prevalent in most parts, we can only imagine the situation back then.</p><p>However, when the time for Tamaki’s marriage came, she just exposed her relationship with Francois.</p><p>As expected, things did not go well with her family, mainly her father, who accused Osaka of tarnishing their family name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leonard-Francois-Naomi-Osakas-father-1-683x1024.jpg><p>Despite all the commotion, the two stuck together, secretly married, and then moved to Osaka.</p><p>Shortly after, the couple gave birth to their two daughters, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mari</a> and Naomi, who are only 18 months apart.</p><p>In hindsight, Leonards’s wife, Tamaki’s family, isolated her for more than 15 years.</p><p>The two families did not reunite until 2008, when they returned to Japan.</p><p>Because of the J<strong>apanese Family Registration Law</strong> (<strong>Koseki</strong>), the sisters adopted their mother’s name.</p><p>The Osaka family stayed in Japan for a few years before moving back to the states.</p><p><strong>READ: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Naomi Osaka’s Parents?- Here Is Everything We Know About Them</a></strong></p><h2>Leonard Francois Taught Mari and Naomi to Play Tennis</h2><p>People may not know this, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Mari</a> and Naomi did not start Tennis as a hobby. Their father, Leonard Francois, led them to Tennis and even taught them how.</p><p>It is funny when you consider Francois was neither a Tennis player nor had coached before.</p><p>In fact, the idea grew on him one random night in 1999 when he saw the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams sisters</a> dominating the French Open.</p><p>After witnessing the act, he was inspired to make his daughters virtually undefeated like the Williams sisters.</p><p>However, he knew nothing about competitive sports. Hence, he resorted to one place he knew best; the Williams sisters.</p><p>Leonard followed the blueprint and training regime of Richard Williams, also known as the father of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Serena</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Venus Williams.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/leonard-002.jpg><p>In the hope of making other Tennis stars like the Williams sisters, Francois began coaching his two young daughters.</p><p>Likewise, in 2001, the whole family moved to New York, and slowly, his plan took action.</p><p>After teaching them the basics, Leonard’s family again moved to Florida so that his daughters could have better opportunities. And luckily, his plan and dedication paid off in the end.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aleeza Goggins: Ex-wife of David Goggins- Age, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></strong></p><h2>Leonard Francois | Homeschooling His Daughters</h2><p>With the sole purpose of making his daughters into a Tennis power duo, Leonard spent his whole time with them.</p><p>While his wife supported the family financially, Francois’s only focus was to make them strong and undefeated.</p><p>Because of it, Leonard homeschooled his daughters rather than sending them to an American high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Naomi-Osakas-childhood-photo-with-her-sister.webp><p>He did not want anything to hinder their Tennis practice while also maintaining their academics.</p><p>According to Leonard, this is one of the many ideas he adopted from Richard Williams’ training blueprint.</p><p><strong>READ: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Naomi Osaka’s Parents?- Here Is Everything We Know About Them</a></strong></p><h2>How Much is Naomi Osaka Worth?</h2><p>The father of the former World Champion, <a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Osaka</a>, Leonard, has not disclosed his income.</p><p>Since childhood, Francois acted as her coach and worked with her until recently.</p><p>Not to mention, Naomi said his father worries about her matches too much. She said,</p><h3>“I think he might take long walks because maybe my matches stress him out.”</h3><p>To this, Naomi added,</p><h3>“When I was growing up my mum always worked, my mother was working a lot because my dad was always with us. He was the one who was our coach.”</h3><p>Meanwhile, the current number 10, Naomi, has an astounding net worth of more than <strong>$60 million</strong>.</p><p>Also, she earned around <strong>$60 million</strong> in a year, making her the highest-paid female athlete in Tennis.</p><h2>Leonard Francois Wanted His Daughters to Represent Japan</h2><p>Among many other things, the Osaka sisters are mostly bombarded with questions regarding their ethnicity.</p><p>Along with that, another issue that raised eyebrows was their decision to represent Japan in international games.</p><p>But unlike what people think, Tamaki and Leonard have been sure about this issue. They have wanted their daughters to play for Japan since their childhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/leonard-004.jpg><p>In a simple sense, the girls are closer to their Japanese life than their western life. They have their friends and family there that love them and support them.</p><p>Another factor that solidified this decision was the lack of support from the United States. Since<a href=# rel=noopener> Mari</a> and Naomi were still amateurs, the Tennis Association of the U.S. refused to support them at all.</p><p>Moreover, Naomi has expressed how she felt more Japanese than American.</p><h3>“My dad thought that since I grew up around my mom and I have a lot of Japanese relatives… I don’t know… I don’t necessarily feel like I’m American. And I wouldn’t know what that feels like.”</h3><p>According to Japanese law, <a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Osaka</a> gave up her American citizenship right after she turned 22.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ed Marinaro Age, Young, Wife, Family, Football, Acting, Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h2>Leonard Francois | Social Media Presence</h2><p>The father of star player <a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Osaka</a> is currently not active on any social media.</p><h2>Leonard Francois | Popularity</h2><p>Being the father of Naomi, Leonard is a searched name worldwide among tennis fans and sports enthusiasts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leonards-Google-search-interest.jpg><p>The above graph shows the google search volume over the internet in the past three months.</p><h2>Leonard Francois | FAQs</h2><h3>What does Leonard Francois do for a living?</h3><p>The father of the world-renowned tennis player is a tennis coach.
