Headhunting of both serving and former UK pilots has been &#34;consistent and widespread&#34; since the end of 2019, a Western official said.
The fighter pilots are being offered lucrative packages of £240,000 a year to train personnel in China's People's Liberation Army."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Some people are in their 50s and left the military some time ago.</p><p>"Money is a strong motivator and some of these people have left defence for quite a while.</p><p>"We are aware of ongoing attempts to recruit serving personnel, but no serving personnel have accepted that offer."</p><p>It's understood the British government is liaising with its allies on the threat.</p><p>"This is a wider issue beyond the UK. This is not just RAF, this is military pilots... it’s a broader issue," the Western official said.</p><p>"We have no reason to believe any of the individuals have broken the Official Secrets Act, but we want to take action to mitigate the risk in the future."</p><p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: "We are taking decisive steps to stop Chinese recruitment schemes attempting to headhunt serving and former UK Armed Forces pilots to train People’s Liberation Army personnel in the People’s Republic of China."</p><p>They said the department is now reviewing the use of confidentiality contracts and non-disclosure agreements across the UK defence sector.</p><p>"The new National Security Bill will create additional tools to tackle contemporary security challenges – including this one," the spokesperson added.</p><p>It comes days after it was revealed China <a href=#>will be declared an official “threat”</a> in a new strategic review of Britain's enemies.</p><p>Ex-PM&nbsp;<a href=#>Boris Johnson's</a> landmark 2021 Integrated Defence and Security Review classed&nbsp;China&nbsp;a “systemic competitor” - but stopped short of saying they were actively hostile to the UK.</p><p>But now&nbsp;Liz Truss is preparing to toughen that stance&nbsp;after announcing a review of the policy last month.</p><p>Top spook Sir Jeremy Fleming said: "China’s great strength combined with fear is driving them into actions that could represent a huge threat to us all."</p><p>In a lecture at the Royal United Services Institute, he said China’s approach to tech dominance puts them against "the whole open, democratic order and the international rules-based system".</p><p>Iain Duncan Smith said the decision was "long overdue".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"We have been campaigning for this," he said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“It is time we stopped messing around and recognised that China poses a threat to the way we live our lives, and it is time now to treat them in the same way we treat Russia."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ31yf5NxanBnkqe2tXnFpbCippdirqSx0mafnpmUncKvwMSdZJygmaOubsDRmqCnZZaetKnAxKtkqaGcpMG0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./t-pain-tiktok-car-drama.html><span>←</span><span>T-Pain Shares His Pickle Rick Car Drama on TikTok Details</span></a>
