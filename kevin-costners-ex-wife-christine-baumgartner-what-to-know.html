The Oscar winner was previously married to ex-wife <strong>Cindy Silva</strong> from 1978 to 1994. The duo share daughters Annie and Lily, born in 1984 and 1986, respectively, and son Joe, born in 1988. Costner is also the father of son Liam, born in 1996, whom he shares with ex <a href=#><strong>Bridget Rooney</strong></a>.</p><p>Four months prior to his split from Baumgartner, the Dances With Wolves actor shared how his wife supported him when a flooded freeway kept them from attending the <a href=#>January 2023 Golden Globes</a>.</p><p>“Nobody’s sadder than us that <a href=#>we can’t be there</a> at the Golden Globes. Chris had a beautiful dress, I was looking forward to walking down the red carpet with her,” the California native said via Instagram minutes before the awards show began. “She went out and bought me some gold and yellow and black and silver balloons, and so we’re gonna [watch] the television and see what happens.”</p><p>The director <a href=#>went on to win</a> the trophy for Best Actor In a Drama Series for his role in Yellowstone. In a February Instagram video, Costner revealed that his <a href=#>family “stood up and cheered”</a> for him while watching the broadcast from their home. “Christine realized that my heart was a little bit low,” he said.</p><p>Costner previously told <a href=# rel=noopener>Parade </a>in May 2012 that the key to a successful marriage is the ability to sincerely apologize.</p><p>“I know that sounds so simple,” he explained at the time. “If you’re willing to tell somebody that you love them, are you also willing to say you’re sorry? You need to, even when you think you’re in the right.”</p><p>Although the Emmy winner has yet to publicly address his split from Baumgartner, he shared his feelings on <a href=#>divorce</a> during a May 2012 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter </a>while discussing the end of his first marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“No one wants their marriage to end, and it did,” he shared at the time. “You are going to see the people you love most, your children, only <a href=#>half as much</a>. That’s a huge loss.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Costner’s estranged wife Baumgartner:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKbCyKdknKejqbumvtJmnLFlp56zpnnCoamiq6Seu6Z5wZqspp%2BRp8GvsdFmrqGZpGLBsHnKp6awZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brother-ali-19770730-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brother Ali (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
