Pete was like, ‘Why would you do this to me? We look so stupid, we have 40 oz [drinks] and we’re at Sandra Bullock’s house. Why didn’t you tell me this was where we were going?’”</p><p class=p1>Kelly, who got <a href=#>engaged to <strong>Megan Fox</strong> in January</a>, then noted the 28-year-old&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#>got payback during Kelly’s birthday celebration</a> last month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Machine-Gun-Kelly-and-Pete-Davidson-Showed-Up-at-Sandra-Bullocks-Easter-Party-with-40oz-Beers-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>“[Pete] texted like, ‘Hey, I’m about to come to your party can I bring a +1?’ I was like, ‘Of course.’ He pulls up and his plus one is <a href=#><strong>Robert Pattinson</strong></a>,” Kelly told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a>. “I was like, ‘You brought Batman?’ It’s funny <a href=#>when you become Batman no one refers to you anymore as your actual name</a>, you’re just Batman.”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Twilight&nbsp;</i>actor, 36,<a href=#> took over the Caped Crusader mantle in Matt Reeves’&nbsp;<i>The Batman&nbsp;</i></a>upon its March release, Kelly wrote in his&nbsp;<i>Good Mourning&nbsp;</i>film that <a href=#>his character, London Ransom, was also up for the gig</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s a comedy that just goes back to days of gag humor and, you know, $50,000 lobster puppets that we thought we were going to crush,” Kelly (real name Colson Baker) teased of the film, currently in theaters, during the Thursday late-night appearance. “The cast is oddly great, the budget was [small] and the cast [roster is huge].”</p><p class=p1><i>Good Mourning</i>, which Kelly wrote and directed, <a href=#>also stars the 36-year-old&nbsp;<i>Jennifer’s Body&nbsp;</i>actress</a>, <a href=#><strong>Dove Cameron</strong></a> and Davidson. Kelly’s bond with the standup comic goes way beyond&nbsp;<i>Good Mourning&nbsp;</i>costars after they first connected years earlier.</p><p class=p1>“We met each other at&nbsp;Wild ‘N Out&nbsp;way back,” the “Emo Girl” performer previously told<i>&nbsp;<a href=#>Billboard</a></i>&nbsp;in August 2018. “And then met each other years later when I was filming that&nbsp;Mötley Crüe&nbsp;movie [<i>The Dirt</i>], ’cause he’s in that Mötley Crüe movie. And then we were just stuck down there in New Orleans, and <a href=#>we were both just, like, super stoners</a>. [We] listened to the same music. … So that’s my boy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kelly, who <a href=#>previously teased Davidson could be the best man at his wedding to Fox</a>, has <a href=#>continued to support the&nbsp;<i>Meet Cute&nbsp;</i>actor in good times and bad</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t have any siblings, you know, so when you have someone like Pete, like, that’s like my little brother,” Kelly said during an appearance on <a href=#>“The Howard Stern Show”</a> in September 2020. “He’s like my best friend but also like a little brother, so, like, you have the opportunity to live that dynamic of, like, having a sibling. So, obviously, to me, that’s like the dream.
