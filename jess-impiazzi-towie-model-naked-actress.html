Speaking exclusively to The Sun on Sunday, Jess admitted: “I have no desire to be this crazy reality star who wants to run about being nuts, or a glamour model wanting to prance around naked any more."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

One of my all-time favourite actresses is <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>, and I would love to be like her.”</p><p>The glamorous brunette, who is dating former England and Stoke footballer <a href=#>Jermaine Pennant</a>, 39, made her telly debut on hit ITV reality show The Only Way is Essex in 2012 and went on to star in MTV’s Ex On The Beach.</p><p>She returned to the MTV show in 2016 for the fifth series but withdrew after three episodes following a <a href=#>string of anxiety attacks</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Jess Impiazzi">Read more on Jess Impiazzi</h2><p>Jess said: “I hated being a <a href=#>reality</a> star. In the first series of Ex On The Beach I was only 20. It was such a long time ago, a different lifetime, I have grown up, I am a different person.</p><p>“Back then I would get hammered and jump in the swimming pool naked and get intimate with my boyfriend. I used my looks for validation. I realise now that the life of a reality star is vacuous and holds no real meaning.”</p><p>She added: “Reality TV is a dangerous place. Viewers think they know you and like to judge you. It is a breeding ground for trolls.</p><p>“I was getting my validation from those people. It was very unhealthy. I couldn’t be authentically me...It is a tiring and soul-destroying place to be. You are feeding yourself to the lions.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>“My advice to younger people is to never do a reality show.”</p><p>Jess was a finalist in <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a> in 2018, “The Year Of The Woman” series, and revealed how she wanted to break the stereotype of glamour models.</p><p>But a conversation with fellow contestant, former Coronation Street star <a href=#>Amanda Barrie</a>, led her to return to her career in acting.</p><h2>ACTING RETURN</h2><p>Since then she has appeared in several low-budget films, including the 2019 horror film The Tombs, the 2016 British crime drama Retribution and 2017’s action film Dangerous Game, alongside fellow reality stars <a href=#>Darren Day</a> and <a href=#>Calum Best</a>.</p><p>And her latest project sees her play a footballer’s fiancée in the <a href=#>Amazon Prime</a> comedy Keep Calm & Carry On, which starts next month.</p><p>She promises she will be seen in a whole new light.</p><p>Jess said: “I play this late-20s wag, Danielle, whose famous football fiancé dumps her, and I have to move home with my eccentric mum, Susan, and stepfather Peter.</p><p>“I might be dating a former footballer but I’m not a wag, I’m a real homebody and I’m quiet.</p><p>“Jermaine and I love watching Netflix and going to the gym.</p><p>“We like going to work and we motivate one another.</p><p>“Danielle’s whole dream has just been to be this wag who lives off her footballer partner, whereas I could never stop work because I would lose purpose.</p><p>“I can’t be one of those people who doesn’t do anything. Whenever I feel like I’m lacking purpose, that’s when I need to focus, because I can’t bear that feeling.</p><p>“So I am the complete opposite to my character in that respect.</p><p>“But it’s ironic that I’m with Jermaine and Danielle is a wannabe wag. But she got dumped and I haven’t!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jermaine-pennant-jess-impiazzi-arriving-uk-premiere-the.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jess-impiazzi-n-dangerous-game-taken-without-permission.jpg><p>Jess has been dating the ex-<a href=#>Liverpool</a> winger since last Christmas and insists she has not been put off by his chequered past.</p><p>Exposed to drugs, crime and alcohol as a child, Jermaine had four different step-mums by the age of ten. Married and divorced, he developed a reputation for being a party boy and serial cheater. But Jess insists she has never seen that side of him.</p><h2>CHEQUERED PAST</h2><p>She said: “He is really devoted to me and has such a kind heart. He helps look after my mum Debbie, who is blind, and is great at sorting things out, like her phone.</p><p>“For the past few years I had been my dad Colin’s carer and Jermaine was at my dad’s bedside when he <a href=#>passed away from lung cancer</a> recently.</p><p>“He had never seen a person die close up before so that was really tough for him but he stood by me.”</p><p>Jess has also had a difficult past. As a child she witnessed domestic violence in the home and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result. She got a scholarship to performing arts school Italia Conti as a teenager but had to leave when her mum started to lose her sight due to the condition uveal effusion syndrome.</p><p>Jess also suffered the trauma of losing her 13-month-old nephew, who died of <a href=#>meningitis</a> while he was in her care. It led her to fall into a terrible depression and she attempted suicide.</p><p>&nbsp;She went through counselling and started taking anti-depressants. She later accepted an offer from Towie to try to get back into acting.</p><p>Jess, who dumped her ex-husband, rugby player <a href=#>Denny Solomona</a>, after he cheated on her in 2017, was targeted by trolls when she appeared on Celebrity Big Brother. She said: “While I was on there everyone watching hated my ‘squeaky’ voice and I had about 96 per cent of England saying how much they hated it.</p><p>“Things like that were really bad for my mental health and I started to spiral into <a href=#>depression</a>.”</p><p>She decided to cut back on using social media and stopped posting bikini shots of herself, losing more than 100,000 followers on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jess-impiazzi-the-tombs-horror-film-2019-taken-without.jpg><p>Jess said: “It doesn’t bother me because I no longer align with what some people want to see.</p><p>“Now I’m just happy with who I am. I’m happy in my mind, so therefore I am happy in my body.”</p><p>And being in a stable relationship with Jermaine is also a big help. She said: “This has been the most confident I’ve been in myself — in my looks, in my personality — that I have ever been.</p><p>“Jermaine does contribute to that. I don’t need constant validation but I know if I do myself up and we go out for dinner, he’ll go, ‘You look great’. And I’m like, ‘Thank you’.</p><p>“It just gives you that lift. But it’s not something I base my worth on any more. And that’s what I used to do.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“There have been a lot of difficult times in my past but I don’t regret them because they have all brought me to where I am today, and to Jermaine.</p><p>“He wants me to do well, is supportive of my dreams to keep acting and I don’t think I have ever been more suited to someone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jess-impiazzi-keep-calm-carry-on.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/day-1-pictured-jess-impiazzi-amanda-barrie-planet-photos.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlpaoN5gZBqZqOdo6h6qrnPopizspliwbDDyJ5kpqeUmrluusCknJ1lkZjBs7HSrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mtv-the-challenge-casting-call.html><span>←</span><span>How Contestants Get on the Show</span></a>
