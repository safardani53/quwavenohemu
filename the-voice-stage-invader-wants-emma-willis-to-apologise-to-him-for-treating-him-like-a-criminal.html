What if I had died? What would she have said?</p><p>"Emma Willis doesn't know the meaning of philosophy or a philosopher. She treated me like a criminal for holding up ideas. How can she be so insensitive?"</p><p>Konstantin caused chaos during the live final of The Voice on Sunday by <a href=#>storming the stage as the runner-up results were revealed by host Emma</a>.</p><p>The Sun's Bizarre column earlier <a href=#>exclusively revealed his identity and his claims that he was nearly KILLED by ITV security</a>.</p><p>He was pounced on by security guards as he held up a sign which read: "I demand change in the way big media control information based on four ideas: positive thinking, movement, creativity and fairness."</p><p>The wannabe rapper phoned up Bizarre's Dan Wootton to vent his anger after he called him an "idiot" and <a href=#>ITV's Lorraine branded him a "buffoon"</a>.</p><p>The prankster lives in North West London but claims he was born in "Mars".</p><p>Asked where he is originally from, he replied: "I am from Mars, from a different planet. From the planet of creativity and ideas. I was born in Mars."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST POPULAR</h2></p><p>Despite interrupting the talent show final, The Sun's Bizarre column can reveal that Konstantin auditioned for Britain's Got Talent five years ago as a wannabe rapper - but failed to make it through.</p><p>He admitted: "I tried Britain's Got Talent, I was trying to rap a few ideas around five years ago, but never again. Britain's Got Talent is based on people that don't have talent."</p><p>Konstantin has also performed live on BBC Three for Radio 1 breakfast host Nick Grimshaw's panel show Sweat The Small Stuff.</p><p>His stunt live on ITV's The Voice is not the first time he has attempted to invade media organisations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000313534342.jpg><p>The activist claims he has previously been arrested for similar efforts at Fox, the BBC and the New York Times.</p><p>He said: "I have spent ten years trying to express my ideas. I was arrested in New York city by Fox TV, no one spoke about it. I was arrested by the BBC for trying to express my ideas, no one spoke about it. I was arrested at the New York Times, no one spoke about it."</p><p>The self-professed philosopher also dismissed claims that his stage invasion could have been mistaken for an attempted terror attack in light of recent events.</p><p>He blasted: "I was holding up ideas, not attacking anyone, not resisting any order. A man with a gun is totally different from a man with ideas."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000313328388.jpg><p>After being released last night Konstantin took to social media to vent his fury, accusing security guards of almost killing him and branding ITV bosses "Nazis".</p><p>He tweeted: "The Security of @ITV almost choked me to death for wantin to show a few ideas – Big Media praises security! #TheVoiceUK,</p><p>“#CreativeismMovement The #EVIL #Nazis of @ITV must have learnt from #Hitler the way they murder independent thinkers. #TheVoiceUK #Einstein.</p><p>“#CreativeismMovement I will report tomorrow to the corrupted @metpoliceuk Because I was choked to death for showing a few ideas #TheVoiceUK.”</p><p>Fans were left bewildered when he leapt onto the stage holding a piece of paper showing a message, but viewers unable to figure out what was written.</p><p>He later shared a picture of the sign in progress as he designed it on his PC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000313531386.jpg><p>It read: "Journalists of the big media or middle-age and ancient priests; Stop murdering independent thinking.</p><p>"Oppression of ideas is not freedom. Thug-life is not art.</p><p>"War is not peace.</p><p>"I demand change in the way big media control information based on four ideas.</p><p>"Positive thinking. Movement creativity. And fairness."</p><p>Konstantin is also an author under his nickname Dr AC.</p><p>He recently penned the e-book Ten Original Qualities That One Needs to Change The World: Art, Ideas and Creativity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000313531156.jpg><p>It is yet to be reviewed on Amazon, but according to the author, the tome "intends to show what one needs in order to change the world.</p><p>"In this Ebook I show the right way to the world. And I do that by explaining ten original qualities of the beings of being which I think are embedded deep in the heart and soul of humanity.</p><p>"So in this Ebook you will find the answers of questions like 'How can one be a creator? What does one need to lead, bring change and create?'"</p><p>Police were not called to the TV studios last night and Konstantin was escorted off the premises by security staff.</p><p>A statement from ITV read: "During the results this evening there was a brief interruption on stage, which was dealt with immediately by security. The show continued as planned.”</p><p>The Voice was won by <a href=#>Mo Adeniran </a>who beat Welsh duo <a href=#>Into The Ark</a> and singer Jamie Miller to the prize of a record deal with Polydor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWiama%2Bus77EaGprbGNsfXp706GcZq6fnrCmedKtmKCdXZ67t63Dnqlmr5GjwbR5xKakmmWnnrmttdJmq6hlkaW8rbvGoqqeZaSkeqm1zGadqKpdqb%2BmrdOipaBlmJ66brjIpJxmmV2Yv6q5yKeYpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-rodrigo-bridgerton-rege-jean-page-drivers-licence-snl.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Rodrigo 'loses her mind' as Bridgerton's Reg-Jean Page sings her ballad Drivers License for</span></a>
