The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>This Is Us</a> cast is very much like a family when the cameras aren’t rolling. Faithe spoke EXCLUSIVELY with<strong> HollywoodLife</strong> and revealed how <strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong> and <strong>Susan Kelechi Watson</strong> have helped her over the past 4 seasons. “One time on set I was afraid of messing up my lines and forgetting them so Mr. Sterling and Ms. Susan were very comforting and they’re like, ‘It’s okay if you mess up. That’s how you learn.’ I’ve learned so much stuff from them,” Faithe said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Faithe has also become close to <strong>Eris Baker</strong> and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Lyric Ross</strong></a>, who play her onscreen siblings. “They’re like my real sisters,” Faithe continued. “We’ve been to each other’s birthday parties and we go to dinner, too. We’re always having fun on set and laughing. We’ve gone to Disneyland and Knott’s Berry Farm, too.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In the midst of playing Annie, Faithe also got the opportunity to playing Angela, the younger version of <strong>Regina King’s</strong> character, in HBO’s Watchmen. “I loved playing Angela and it was something different because Annie is always happy and has funny comments,” Faithe said. “For Angela, I had to be more serious and stuff and I always had to be sad, but it was really fun playing her. I had fun going to Atlanta and then the director <strong>Mr.</strong> <strong>David [Semel]</strong> always gave such good points and stuff. He was really nice to me and the whole cast was amazing. I loved it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Faithe is a talented rising star and looks up to<strong> Yara Shahadi</strong> and<strong> Zendaya</strong> as role models. “I love Zendaya’s style and Yara is just amazing with how she got to go to school and go to work and balanced it all at the same time,” Faithe gushed. As for her advice for those who want to get into acting at a young age like she did, Faithe stressed to “always have fun and always believe in yourself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH10e49sZq2gmah6qr%2BMrqpmnpGewamxjKGcq6WRo3qius2inGavkamwqbnEp2SipqSav7e1xLBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./husband-secretly-filming-me-whilst-sex-devastated.html><span>←</span><span>My husband has been secretly filming me whilst we have sex - I'm devastated</span></a>
