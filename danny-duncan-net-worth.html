But not all of them are like that, especially YouTuber <a href=#>Danny Duncan</a>. Known for his hilarious vlog, pranks, and “Virginity Rocks” merch, the <a href=#>YouTube</a> star has amassed quite a bit of wealth over his long tenure. Danny grew up with a single mom who battled alcoholism. At one point, he was nearly unhoused, all of which make his accomplishments all the more impressive.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Naturally, we can’t help but wonder what Danny’s net worth is. He’s been building up his online persona since 2014, beginning as a personal trainer and skateboard instructor and pivoting into a more comedic online persona. By sticking to his brand identity, Danny’s been able to monetize his brand through collaborations, businesses, and other ventures.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Danny Duncan has an estimated net worth of $20 million.</h2><p>According to a profile in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, Danny has an estimated net worth of $20 million. However, his businesses may be worth much more. By collaborating with Zumiez, Tillys, and Spencer’s, he was able to sell his “Virginity Rocks” merch, making millions in the process. But he never sells out — he doesn’t work with businesses that don’t match his brand identity, turning down deals as large as $2 million.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Danny Duncan</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">YouTube Personality, Entrepreneur, Clothing Designer, Comedian</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $20 million</p><p>Danny Duncan is a YouTube personality-turned-businessman known for his pranks, vlogs, and skate culture.</p><p><strong>Birthname: </strong>Daniel Duncan</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> July 27, 1992</p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Englewood, Fla.</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Susan Duncan</p><p><strong>Education: </strong>Lemon Bay High School (graduated 2010)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In fact, Danny doesn’t even monetize his YouTube videos. He often skirts YouTube’s monetization guidelines to make the videos he wants to make instead of videos that will make money. And while the strategy was risky at first, it’s clearly paying off.</p><p>Since launching his YouTube career, Danny has branched off into several other ventures. He bought a 94-acre plot of land in his hometown of Englewood, Fla. for $3.69 million, which he plans to convert into his personal haven, complete with the beginning of a mini-golf franchise and a race track.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Danny and his manager, Stefan Toler, were some of the first in the influencer sphere to set up partnerships with businesses to sell merch in 2019. They even partnered later with Hooters, and all of these have led to over $150 million in gross total product sales. Danny also partnered with cartoonist Harry Hambley to create the family-friendly comic series, Ketnipz. The comics have already collaborated with Hot Wheels and Samsung, and can hopefully monetize more with a television series.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition, Danny knows that his fanbase is mostly male and into the outdoors, so he created the Good Sport brand to make products such as Backyard Pong and Bubble Bash. And now, Danny is using his amassed wealth to go into franchising. He partnered with franchisee Neil Hershman to purchase frozen yogurt shop 16 Handles. Soon, he also plans to launch an energy shot called Matador.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>So whether he’s making videos, making merch, making comics, making fro-yo, or making anything else you could possibly think of, Danny is definitely making money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vuthmm66mk5a7brrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halloween-costumes-looked-like-100-years-ago-video-20152010.html><span>←</span><span>This Is What Halloween Costumes Looked Like 100 Years Ago: Video</span></a>
